"Ballot boxes burned, hundreds of votes destroyed in Washington, Oregon arson cases","Two ballot boxes were burned in Washington and Oregon on Monday, possibly damaging hundreds of mail-in votes with only about a week to go before Election Day. The Portland Police Bureau responded to reports of a fire in the Buckman neighborhood of the city at about 3:30 a.m. The fire had been extinguished by security personnel who work in the area, and officers soon found an ""incendiary device,"" characterizing the crime as arson. The Vancouver Police Department in nearby southern Washington said in a statement that they responded to an arson at a ballot box at 4 a.m. They found smoke coming out of the box and a ""suspicious object"" next to it. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement to USA TODAY that it is ""coordinating with federal, state and local partners to actively investigate the two incidents."" The FBI declined to comment on whether the arsons would be investigated as a domestic terror incident in a follow-up email. Clark County auditor Greg Kimsey said that a large number of ballots had been destroyed in the Vancouver fire at a joint press conference. ""We are still in the process of coming up with a closer number, but it certainly was hundreds,"" Kimsey said. Kimsey said that the fire suppression system in the Vancouver ballot box did not work. The last pick-up from the ballot box occurred at 11 a.m. Saturday, Kimsey told USA TODAY in an interview. Kimsey said that voters who believe their ballot was in the box when the fire occurred can request a new ballot at the county's voting website. He further said that there will be increased police and civilian security around the drop boxes and ballot pick-ups will occur at 5:30 p.m. Multnomah County election official Tim Scott said in the press conference that only three ballots had been destroyed in the Portland fire and that those voters would be contacted. The boxes that were burned are located about 15 miles away from each and police officials said that they believe the arsons are connected. Vancouver police said that Monday's arson was similar to one that occurred Oct. 8 before ballots were being mailed, according to The Oregonian. The Vancouver ballot box is located in Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, where Democratic House Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is attempting to retain her seat, which she won by less than 3,000 votes in 2022 against Republican challenger Joe Kent. Both candidates condemned the arsons on Monday. ""Southwest Washington cannot risk a single vote being lost to arson and political violence,"" Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement. ""We can’t yield to intimidation, and we must continue to stand up against unpatriotic acts such as this one. ""Stay focused on driving voter turn out & early voting, don’t be deterred from voting by a cowardly act of terrorism,"" Kent said on X.

"Creepy crawly spiders coming into your home? Don't kill them, experts say.","Fall is the time of year when homeowners may be noticing more spiders scurrying across their kitchen floors and setting up camp by weaving complex webs in the dark corners of their basements. Turns out, that as temperatures drop, our houses and the heating they provide are ideal places for eight-legged arachnids to find shelter, look for mates and hunt for prey to eat. Of course, unless you're an arachnologist, there's a good chance you don't particularly care to share your living space with the creepy crawlers. The urge to grab the nearest shoe, book or other flat object to squish any spider you see may be hard to resist. But many experts – yes, even pest control businesses – caution homeowners to exercise a little restraint. Here's why you may be noticing more spiders in your house, and why you should reconsider killing them. Though spiders are abundant from spring through fall across the United States, experts warn that more may be noticed inside our homes when temperatures start to drop and they seek out warm spaces to take shelter for the winter. Fall is also the time of year that most arachnids reach maturity and are full-grown, which may account for why you're noticing them more often. Our homes are rife with window sills and other small crevices in which spiders can hide, while trash cans and compost bins provide a plentiful food source of scavenging insects, said Lisa Gonzalez, a program manager at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, home to the spider pavilion where about 300 spiders of up to 15 species live. What's more, structures like houses provide plenty of sturdy attachment points for their webs. That is to say, our homes are great places for spiders to live, which means it's also where they're going to reproduce. Late summer and early fall is typically when male webspinners, hoping to put their newly-developed sex organs to the test, leave their webs in search of female mates, said Anne Danielson-Francois, associate professor of biological sciences at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. The female spiders, depending on species, typically conserve their energy and remain at their spun homes, waiting on the males to come to them. ""They are not necessarily more abundant than in the summertime, but individuals are more visible because they are larger,"" Danielson-Francois said. ""A small web might go unnoticed in your kitchen window, but once that spider has grown to full size and spins a web that covers a quarter of the window, you could not miss it."" The rule of thumb, experts say, should be this: If the spider isn't bothering you, then don't bother it. ""If you can allow an eight-legged roommate, it can benefit you,"" Danielson-Francois said. ""And they provide free Halloween decorations for your home, wherever you prefer them – inside or out."" So, what is the benefit of a mutual existence with a creature whose mere sighting inside a home sends many fleeing from the room? It's because spiders are predators that keep insect populations in check. If left alone spiders provide free pest control, eating more obnoxious pests such as flies, said Allen Lawrance, associate curator of entomology at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum located in Chicago and operated by the Chicago Academy of Science. Even companies who make a profit by eliminating unwanted pests recommend that home owners leave spiders alone. On its website, Orkin touts the advantages of having some of the creepy-crawlers around, writing that the arachnids can keep away (or feed on) pests that are actually harmful, like disease-carrying ticks and fleas. ""Spiders are also extremely beneficial to our ecosystem and control the number of bugs that destroy plants and crops, which is why scientists ask us not to kill them,"" Orkin writes. In its own post, Romney Pest Control largely agreed, adding that the presence of dangerous spiders such as the brown recluse spider, whose bite often requires medical treatment, may require contacting a professional. Arachnologists do acknowledge that many people are fearful of spiders and may not want them around. But there's no need to burn your house down to rid yourself of the critters. The important thing, though, is to remember that most species of spiders commonly found inside homes – like cobweb spiders and cellar spiders (better known as ""daddy longlegs"") – are not dangerous. ""While all spiders do produce some venom to help capture and consume their prey, none of these pose any real threat to humans,"" Lawrance said. While seeing spiders on a regular basis may be a sign of an infestation requiring professional help, a stray spider here or there is no cause for concern. But for those who just can't bring themselves to tolerate the presence of spiders, they have a few options recommended by arachnologists and pest control companies alike: ""Don’t feel bad for the spider, they can survive outside quite well,"" Danielson-Francois said. ""With substances in their blood that act like antifreeze, some species can overwinter under tree bark or in leaf litter just fine."" Even Gonzalez said she removes widow spiders, which have venom that can cause problematic reactions if they bite, from her mailbox and underneath patio furniture. ""Every other spider I see in and around my house,"" she said, ""is welcome to set up camp."" Editor's note: A version of this story was last published in 2023.

NASA identifies 9 possible landing spots for 2026 mission returning humans to the moon,"NASA plans to bring humankind back to the moon but first needs to figure out exactly where to land. The space agency has outlined nine potential lunar landing sites for its Artemis III mission, the agency's first planned return to the moon in over five decades. The mission, slated for 2026, intends to land near the lunar South Pole, where astronauts will visit unexplored areas, according to NASA. The nine regions selected are areas where crew can safely land to help uncover new discoveries and better grasp how to live on the lunar surface, according to NASA. The agency has not determined a priority ranking for the selected regions. During the selection process experts considered terrain suitability, launch window availability, lighting conditions, science potential and communication capabilities with Earth, among other factors. NASA officials also considered the combined trajectory capabilities of its Space Launch System rocket, the Orion spacecraft and Starship Human Landing System. ""The Moon’s South Pole is a completely different environment than where we landed during the Apollo missions,"" Artemis lunar science lead Sarah Noble said in a statement. ""It offers access to some of the Moon’s oldest terrain, as well as cold, shadowed regions that may contain water and other compounds. Any of these landing regions will enable us to do amazing science and make new discoveries."" NASA has selected nine potential landing regions, each with its diverse geological characteristics and flexibility for mission landing. Each spot is in the lunar South Pole, which has never been explored in a crewed mission and features permanently shadowed areas that can preserve resources like water. The following lunar sites have been considered: The last human to land on the moon was on Dec. 19, 1972, during NASA's Apollo 17 mission. The astronauts on that mission were the last to visit the moon and the last to travel more than 400 miles from the Earth, according to the National Space Air and Space Museum. Humankind first touched down on the moon on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission in which Neil Armstrong became the first man to step foot on the moon. Artemis III, which will send two astronauts to the surface of the moon, is scheduled for September 2026. Artemis II, which will send astronauts around the moon, is slated for September 2025.",https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/29/moon-landing-nasa-artemis-iii-mission/75907276007/
"Tennessee man pleads guilty to killing Eliza Fletcher, a mom of 2 jogging in Memphis","A Tennessee man pleaded guilty Monday to kidnapping and killing Memphis mother Eliza Fletcher during her morning jog in 2022. Cleotha Abston, 40, was able to avoid the death penalty with the guilty plea to first-degree murder and will face life in prison without the possibility of parole. Fletcher, who was 34 at the time of her death, was abducted while out on a run in the early hours of Sept. 2, 2022. Her body was not found until three days later. ""No legal resolution and no sentence can diminish the anguish of Liza's murder,"" Fletcher's family said in a statement sent to the news media. ""We accept the outcome that her murderer has pled guilty to all charges, will wake up in prison for the rest of his life and cannot harm anyone else. We are very grateful for the determination and professionalism of law enforcement and the district attorney's office."" Abston was arrested on Sept. 3, 2022, a day after Fletcher's abduction launched a multi-day, multi-agency manhunt across Memphis. He was initially charged with especially aggravated kidnapping and tampering with evidence. Footage from the University of Memphis campus, where Fletcher was taken while on a morning run, showed someone in a dark SUV approach Fletcher and force her into the vehicle after a brief struggle. First-degree murder and first-degree murder in perpetration of a kidnapping charges were added to Abston's case a day after Fletcher's remains were found. Abston pleaded guilty to Fletcher's killing to avoid the death penalty, his attorney, Juni Ganguli, told USA TODAY. Ganguli and attorney Lauren Pasley both advised Abston to plead guilty due to the mounting evidence against him. Ganguli added that a jury would have likely imposed the death penalty during a sentencing hearing. ""I've had other death penalty cases where the prosecution had agreed to sentences of life without parole following the guilt phase of trials,"" Ganguli said in his statement. ""There was overwhelming publicity and public outcry in this case."" Abston was convicted of a 2021 rape over six months before entering the plea on Monday. That rape went unsolved until DNA taken in a rape kit matched Abston. The trial spanned three days in April, when Abston was indicted for three different counts, aggravated rape, especially aggravated kidnapping and being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. The jury convicted him of aggravated rape and convicted felon in possession of a handgun, and found him guilty of the lesser charge of aggravated kidnapping. Fletcher was the mother of two children and a teacher at St. Mary's Episcopal School. Before working joining St. Mary's, she taught Kindergarten at Promise Academy in Nashville and also coached soccer. In 2006, she graduated from Hutchison School in Memphis, according to the all-girl's school's website, and later earned a bachelor's degree in exercise science at Baylor University. She earned her masters of art in teaching with an emphasis in elementary education at Belmont University, according to a post from St. Mary's. She is also remembered as an avid runner, having run completed the St. Jude marathon in Memphis with a time of 3:26:09. She finished 22nd place out of all the women running the St. Jude marathon that year. Her placement allowed her to qualify for the elite Boston Marathon. George Robertson, the senior pastor at Second Presbyterian Church, said Fletcher was ""full of life."" She married Richard Fletcher III at the church in 2014, according to a 2015 report by Memphis Magazine. The couple shared two sons. ""She and her husband Ritchie are both very active and great leaders in our congregation,"" Robertson told the Commercial Appeal, part of the USA TODAY Network. ""They have two little boys who have come up to me every week and give me a hug."" In a statement, her family addressed Abston: ""We have no idea what happened to you to turn you into someone so filled with a desire to hurt people. Whatever it was, it does not excuse or explain what you have done. You have changed our lives forever, and nothing will ever be the same,"" they said. ""Your actions were evil. There is no other word for it. You murdered Liza, even though she did nothing to deserve it.""",https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/28/cleotha-abston-guilty-plea-eliza-fletcher/75904708007/
Cold case: 'Lake Lady Jane Doe' identified 38 years after body found in Louisiana lake,"On June 19, 1986, a fisherman found a woman's body floating in a lake in southeastern Louisiana. For nearly four decades, the unidentified homicide victim was only known by the name ""Lake Lady Jane Doe"" until last week, when the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff’s Office in Covington announced new DNA technology had identified the victim. The sheriff's office said that the woman had been identified as 33-year-old Pamela Lee Hupp. As of Monday, Hupp's killer's identity remained unknown, the sheriff's office told USA TODAY. After Hupp's remains were discovered in Lake Pontchartrain near Slidell, about 30 miles northeast of New Orleans, they were turned over to the St. Tammany Parish Coroner’s Office. Hupp's manner of death was ruled a homicide, coroner's spokesperson James Hartman told USA TODAY on Monday, and her death certificate showed she died as a result of asphyxia. Officials also said she was pregnant. At the time of the discovery, she was estimated to be 20 to 30 years old, according to Othram, the DNA lab that eventually helped identify Hupp. During the investigation, authorities reconstructed Hupp's skull, from which a photograph was captured and released to the public, the sheriff's office said. Her story was also included on a segment that aired on ""America's Most Wanted."" Years later, in September 2022, a grant paved the way for more DNA analysis and genealogy research in the case. Then in April 2023, Othram's efforts helped locate potential family members of the victim who later helped lead to her identity. Born in April 1958, her last known residence was in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It was not immediately known what she was doing in Florida at the time of her killing or how she was killed. “I want to thank the many investigators over the years who worked on this case and sought out available resources and technology to identify and give a name to the victim,” Sheriff Randy Smith released in a statement after the victim's identity was released. “Our detectives will not stop working until they have identified and arrested the person(s) responsible for Ms. Hupp’s death.” Anyone with information about the case is asked to call the sheriff's office at (985) 898-2341 or Detective Winston Harbin at (985) 276-1355.

US Navy officially apologizes for bombarding a native Alaskan community in 1882,"The U.S. Navy made an official apology this week for the bombardment and near destruction of a native Alaskan village 142 years ago. Speaking Saturday in Angoon, Alaska, located about 100 miles south of the state capital of Juneau in the Tongass National Forest, Rear Adm. Mark Sucato, commander of Navy Region Northwest issued the apology on the 142nd anniversary of the attack, which happened on Oct. 26, 1882 and killed six children while leaving the village's surviving residents without food or shelter amid a harsh winter. “The Navy recognizes the pain and suffering inflicted upon the Tlingit people, and we acknowledge these wrongful actions resulted in the loss of life, the loss of resources, the loss of culture, and created and inflicted intergenerational trauma on these clans,” Sucato said at the ceremony, which was livestreamed by the Sealaska Heritage Institute. “The Navy takes the significance of this action very, very seriously and knows an apology is long overdue.” While many details of what caused the destruction at Angoon have been lost to time over the years, what is known is that it began with the accidental death of a Tlingit shaman, who was killed aboard a whaling ship by an exploding harpoon gun. According to the Naval Heritage and History Command, accounts from the time say members of the Tlingit tribe forced the whaling ship to shore and took multiple hostages from the crew, along with demanding a ransom of 200 blankets, prompting the call for help by local officials from the Navy. When the Navy arrived at Angoon, they proceeded to destroy the village − burning canoes, food stores, and homes − leaving six children dead and the survivors stranded, entirely dispossessed. The village received a $90,000 settlement in 1973, and in 1982 the Navy sent a letter to the Kootznoowoo Heritage Foundation acknowledging their role in the affair and writing that, ""The destruction of Angoon should never have happened, and it was an unfortunate event in our history."" The village, however, had long sought an official acknowledgement and apology for the event. ""Thank you, Angoon, for keeping our culture so and so strong,"" said Rosita Worl, president of the Sealaska Heritage Institute, at the ceremony. Last month, the Navy conducted a similar apology, for the burning and bombardment of the Tlingit village of Kake in 1869, according to Alaska Public Media. On Oct. 25, President Joe Biden became the first U.S. president to officially apologize for the abuses committed at Native American boarding schools for more than a century.

"Feds: Massachusetts pizzeria chain owner sentenced for forced labor, deportation threats","The owner of a Massachusetts pizzeria chain was sentenced to more than eight years in prison for physically abusing six employees and threatening them with further violence and deportation if they did not comply with his ""excessive workplace demands,"" federal authorities announced. Stavros Papantoniadis, also known as Steve Papantoniadis, was handed an eight-and-a-half-year sentence in a District of Massachusetts courtroom months after being found guilty of three counts of forced labor and three counts of attempted forced labor, according to a Justice Department news release. “Labor trafficking exploits the vulnerable through fear and intimidation, all in pursuit of the almighty buck. That is what Stavros Papantoniadis did when he violated the rights of the people working in his restaurants. He deliberately hired foreign nationals who lacked authorization to work in the United States and then turned their lack of immigration status against them, threatening them with deportation and violence to keep them under his control,” U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy said in the release. Steven C. Boozang, Papantoniadis' attorney, told USA TODAY that his client was a ""pillar of the community"" and had no quarrels with any of the hundreds of people he's previously employed since he began his business over 32 years ago. ""He had done a lot for the community,"" Boozang said. Lawsuit: Ohio nursing home didn't tell family about fatal pressure wound The 49-year-old from Westwood, Massachusetts forced or attempted to force five men and one woman to do excessive labor at his shop, Stash's Pizza, by abusing them and repeatedly threatening to contact immigration authorities, according to the Justice Department. Federal prosecutors said Papantoniadis ""thinly staffed"" his two Stash's Pizza locations, in Dorchester and Roslindale, on purpose and employed individuals without immigration status to work for 14 hours or more a day for up to seven days a week. One of the employees would work between 84 and 119 hours per week, according to a federal complaint obtained by USA TODAY. In addition to threatening the workers with physical harm and deportation, Papantoniadis monitored them with surveillance cameras and ""constantly demeaned, insulted and harassed them,"" according to the Justice Department. When Papantoniadis learned one of the workers planned on quitting, he ""violently choked him,"" federal authorities said. When other workers told Papantoniadis they intended to quit, the owner told one of them that ""he would kill him"" and call immigration authorities, while he threatened another by telling him he knew where he lived, the Justice Department said. Another worker told authorities that Papantoniadis chased him down Route 1 in Norwood, Massachusetts and falsely reported him to local police so he would return to work at the pizza shop, according to the release. Boozang said the allegations the six workers brought against Papantoniadis were ""extremely suspect"" for several reasons, including the Stash's Pizza owner paying for their vacations, buying their kids Christmas gifts and even paying for one of their weddings. In addition to the things Papantoniadis allegedly did for the six workers, Boozang said he found it odd that no previous employees had complained about his client. ""(Papantoniadis) has had hundreds and hundreds of employees over the years, many who have come back,"" according to the attorney. Papantoniadis also paid the six workers up to $17 an hour for the 70-hour work weeks, which they requested, Boozang said. ""He gave them what they wanted,"" Boozang said. The U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hours Division (DOL-WHD) brought a civil case against Papantoniadis on March 24, 2017, for ""overtime wage violations,"" according to court documents. The civil suit was resolved on March 27, 2019, and five out of the six workers who were a part of the criminal case received compensation for back wages and liquidated damages through Papantoniadis' settlement with the DOL-WHD, court records say. Boozang said the forced labor allegations against Papantoniadis ""came out of the woodwork,"" and that the six workers ""read the script."" Although Boozang's suspicions were raised during Papantoniadis' trial, a jury found his client guilty in June. ""Papantoniadis exploited and abused his employees, denying them the basic dignity every person deserves,"" Michael J. Krol, Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations in New England, said in the release. ""Today’s significant sentence sends a message to employers — employees deserve to work in safety, free from harassment and abuse and exploitative employers will be held to account.""",https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/28/stavros-steve-papantoniadis-stashs-pizza/75895709007/
Ohio family files lawsuit against nursing home after woman's pressure wound death,"An Ohio woman’s family has filed a lawsuit against the nursing home she was treated at after she developed a pressure wound that became infected and ultimately killed her. The nursing home is located in Oregon, a northwest Ohio city just outside of Toledo. Lucy Garcia, 72, was admitted to Arbors at Oregon on Jan. 25, 2023 for long term residential care after having a stroke, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday afternoon in Lucas County. She died nearly a year-and-a-half later on July 2, 2024 due to a pressure ulcer that became infected, leading to sepsis. The Lucas County Coroner performed an autopsy on Garcia and reviewed her medical records from St. Charles Medical Center and Arbors at Oregon. The coroner ruled her manner of death homicide, and an autopsy report obtained lists her death as the result of “caretaker neglect resulting in complications of a sacral pressure wound.” Matt Mooney, an attorney representing the Garcia family, filed the lawsuit on the family’s behalf and said the filing is “the first step towards bringing Lucy Garcia’s killers to justice.” Read more: Ohio family says they plan to sue nursing home after matriarch's death ruled a homicide Citing medical negligence and recklessness, the lawsuit blames the facility for Garcia’s death and calls for at least $25,000 in damages plus attorney’s fees and other expenses. “We will stop at nothing to hold the Arbors and its corporate controllers accountable for creating a system of putting profits over people - a system that they knew caused horrific injuries and death to their residents like Lucy,” Mooney wrote in a statement to USA TODAY on Friday. Arbors at Oregon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Garcia’s stroke had made her heavily reliant on the workers at Arbors at Oregon, her family alleged in the lawsuit. The stroke took a toll on her left side, primarily her left arm, and doctors were aware that she needed help getting in and out of bed, moving around in bed and getting to the bathroom. The facility told the Garcia family that staff would be able to care for their matriarch’s needs. “Arbors at Oregon represented to Lucy’s family that they had sufficient numbers of well trained, qualified, and compassionate nursing staff to provide appropriate care to Lucy and all the other residents under their care,” the lawsuit read. But employees there knew resident needs could not be met and other patients had suffered from injuries such as bedsores, infections, falls and in Garcia’s case, death, the lawsuit alleges. According to the Garcia family’s lawsuit, the facility did not have enough staff members to properly care for residents, and the staff members that were there had not received the proper training, nor were they “compassionate to the needs and rights of the residents,” the lawsuit reads. The lawsuit also alleges that the facility had been investigated for multiple health and safety violations and failed to let Garcia’s family know about the violations, including recent criminal neglect and abuse accusations against nursing staff that led to the death of one patient. While Garcia needed help to do so, she could use the restroom, the lawsuit alleged. Rather than help her to the restroom, staff at Arbors at Oregon put her in adult diapers and told her staff would come and “clean her up” once she soiled herself. She was often left in soiled diapers for extended periods of time, “exposing her skin to her own bodily waste – which resulted in breakdown of the skin on her buttocks,” the lawsuit read. The day after she was admitted to Arbors at Oregon, staff completed an assessment to determine the likeness of her developing pressure or bedsores. She scored a 13, meaning she was at a moderate risk for developing bedsores. To prevent the sores, Garcia needed to be turned and repositioned regularly in bed, but her family alleges Arbors at Oregon’s staff did not do this. Staff first noted that Garcia developed a sore on March 5 this year. Just 8 days later, Arbors at Oregon noted that the “abrasion” had grown and a photo was taken, the lawsuit alleged. The sore developed “in-house,” according to the lawsuit. Staff referred to the sore as an “abrasion.” When skilled nursing facilities have patients who develop bedsores, they must report the bedsores to the Centers for Medicare, which may negatively impact the facility’s quality measures rating, the lawsuit read. According to the Garcia family’s lawsuit, someone at Arbors at Oregon told staff to log bed sores as different types of wounds so the facility’s quality measures score would not be impacted. The family argued that this allowed the facility to dupe members of the public into believing their loved ones would be properly cared for at the facility. By March 25, Arbors at Oregon’s nursing staff had noted that the sore was “resolved” despite it still being visible on her backside, the lawsuit read. There were also discrepancies in her file regarding when the wound began to develop. According to the lawsuit, the facility did not document the wound as a pressure wound until June 13, just over 3 months after it first developed. Her family still hadn’t been told about the pressure wound. On June 19, Arbors at Oregon contacted the Garcia family and told them Garcia was nearing the end of her life, and said she needed to be put in hospice care. Her family came to visit and found her barely responsive, their lawyer wrote in the lawsuit. Garcia’s sons told facility staff that Garcia was recently feeling well enough to go to church. They didn’t understand how things could deteriorate so quickly, according to the lawsuit. Facility staff did not tell the family what happened, nor did they tell her about the wound, the document read. Garcia’s other family members in her room noticed an odor coming from her, then turned her over and saw a loose bandage on her backside that was beginning to peel back. There, they saw her bedsore, which had pus coming from it, the lawsuit read. Family members pushed for her to go to the hospital but the facility was hesitant. Eventually, Arbors at Oregon called an ambulance and Garcia was taken to the hospital. Doctors removed the bandages on her backside and found that she had a Stage 4 bedsore. “All the tissue on her backside down to her bone had died off, including muscle,” the lawsuit read. “The open bedsore was exposed to Lucy’s own feces and urine from Arbors at Oregon leaving her in soiled adult diapers, and the wound was infected with bacteria causing sepsis – a systemic infection of Lucy’s body.” The wound was so deep that bones in Garcia’s back were exposed, the lawsuit read. Doctors treated her with IV antibiotics and cleaned the wound. However, she died on July 2. The Garcia family and their lawyer argued in the lawsuit that she died “as a direct and proximate result of the negligence/recklessness” the nursing home showed when caring for her. Mooney, the family’s lawyer, previously told USA TODAY that Garcia had a large family. She was a single mother, raised four boys and was also a “motherly figure to all the kids in the neighborhood.” She was known to let people stay at her house for the night if they needed it, he said. “Her family really viewed her as the center of their family unit, and she was included in just about every single one of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren's births,” Mooney told USA TODAY in September. She leaves behind four sons, 17 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. This story has been updated to clarify the amount the family is requesting in damages.

What should parents really be worried about this Halloween? Not razors in candy.,"As Halloween approaches, tips often circulate advising parents to check their children's Halloween candy, not for a tasty caramel center, but for potentially unsafe objects — like razor blades. But this year, experts are urging parents and caregivers to be mindful of other, more common, Halloween dangers, like vehicle traffic and food allergies. On average, children are more than twice as likely to get hit by a car while trick-or-treating than any other day, Safe Kids Worldwide, an international nonprofit dedicated to child safety, reports. Here's what adults and children should know before trick-or-treating on Thursday. To help keep kids safe from traffic incidents while traversing streets on Halloween night, Safe Kids Worldwide provides the following tips: The nonprofit also advised parents to think about what types of face coverings their children are wearing, as masks can obstruct a child's vision while walking. Food allergies can also be a dangerous around the Halloween season. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises parents who have children with allergies to check candy labels to ensure allergens aren't present. Parents should also never allow children to eat homemade baked goods they may have received. Generally, children should also never accept or eat items that are not commercially wrapped, the FDA advises. If parents are concerned about potential tampering, they should look for unusual wrapper appearances or discoloration, tiny pinholes, or tears in wrappers. In an effort to aid children navigating food allergies, Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) created the Teal Pumpkin Project. The project encourages households to offer non-food items to trick-or-treaters so allergens may be avoided altogether. FARE recommends items like glow sticks, bubbles, bouncy balls, finger puppets, playing cards, stickers and other Halloween toys as non-food item options. Those looking to participate should visit the FARE website, where they can add their address to the Teal Pumpkin Project Map and find resources for how to let neighbors know. Fear-mongering about dangerous items, like razor blades and poison, in Halloween candy dates back to the 1960s. In October 1964, a New York woman was arrested for handing out ant poison and dog treats to trick-or-treaters, according to the History Channel. When she was questioned, the woman said she had only been joking and gave out these items to children she believed were too old to be trick-or-treating. Fortunately, no children were poisoned. Perhaps the most notable Halloween poisoning took place in October 1974, when a Texas man named Ronald O'Bryan handed out ""cyanide-laced pixie sticks"" to five trick-or-treaters, including his own son, according to the History Channel. Only O'Bryan's son ate the candy and he died soon after. No one saw O'Bryan lace the pixie sticks, but investigators learned that he had pulled out life insurance policies on his children. He was convicted of murder and executed via lethal injection in 1984, according to the History Channel. University of Delaware Sociology professor Joel Best has studied these instances of dangerous items placed in Halloween candy, which he calls ""Halloween Sadism,"" for decades. In 1985, he co-authored ""The Razor Blade in the Apple: The Social Construction of Urban Legends,"" a research article that largely discusses the history of dangerous treats given to children on Halloween. Continuing his research on the topic, Best stated between 1959 and 2012, 85 incidents of ""Halloween Sadism"" have been reported in the United States, per his website. A recent example occurred in 2015, when an Ohio child found a disposable razor blade in a Snickers candy bar received while trick-or-treating, per previous USA TODAY reporting. The child, and others in the area, were fortunately not hurt. Greta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY. Follow her on X and Instagram @gretalcross. Story idea?

Bear attack or murder? Bizarre 911 call leads to manhunt in Tennessee,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. − A manhunt was underway Monday for a slaying suspect who police say used a bogus identity when he made a bizarre 911 call claiming he fell off a cliff while running from a bear near the scenic Cherohala Skyway in rural southeast Tennessee. The call came in on Oct. 18 from near Tellico Plains, Tennessee, about 50 miles southwest of Knoxville in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains. The caller identified himself as Brandon Andrade and said he hit his head and could not move his legs. Monroe County Sheriff Tommy Jones said first responders descending on the scene found a man's body and Andrade's ID. Detectives determined the victim was not Andrade and had been murdered, Jones said. Ten days later the identity of the victim remains a mystery. Sheriff's detectives discovered the ID had been stolen and used several times by Nicholas Hamlett, 45, who was wanted by police in Alabama for a parole violation. Jones said Hamlett used another false name when speaking with detectives after the 911 call. By the time his real identity had been verified, Hamlett had fled the area, Jones said. FBI search: Man said a bear chased him off a cliff when he called 911 An arrest warrant charging first-degree murder has been issued for Hamlett, Jones said in a news release issued Friday. ""Mr. Hamlett is considered armed and dangerous,"" Jones warned. ""If you see Mr. Hamlett, please call 911."" Tellico Plains is on the 43-mile Cherohala Skyway that passes through the Cherokee National Forest, which is federal land and runs to Robbinsville, North Carolina. The Knoxville News Sentinel, part of the USA TODAY Newtork, obtained recordings of the call being relayed by dispatch. “Units en route to the area of Cherohala Skyway at Falls Branch Road. Have a male subject that fell off a cliff. He is unable to move. He was running from a bear. He has 2% battery – unable to get him back on 911. ... Not able to move his legs. Did hit his head. He’s going to be at the falls …” The FBI, state and local authorities are now looking for Hamlett − and for the identity of the victim. The sheriff's office said Monday that there were no updates on the case and that a briefing was planned for Wednesday.

Boo-tiful weather? See what your 2024 Halloween forecast has in store,"You've got the candy, costumes and decorations all ready. Now will the weather cooperate for your Halloween celebrations? Here's how the weather will affect the goblins, ghosts and ghouls in your neighborhood on Halloween evening: The nation's two soggiest spots on Halloween − Thursday − will likely be in portions of the central U.S. and the much of the Northwest. And though warmth will make news in some areas, what will be missing is widespread cold, forecasters said: ""This year, there are no major concerns as far as snow, ice or cold across much of the country,"" AccuWeather meteorologist Paul Pastelok said in an online forecast. ""A cold front will sweep across the central U.S. mid to late week, bringing the chance of rain from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi Valley on Halloween,"" said Weather.com meteorologist Caitlin Kaiser in an online forecast. Pastelok added that ""thunderstorms can occur from Houston northward to Little Rock and Memphis, Tennessee,"" noting that multiple showers and thunderstorms in this region may warrant bringing an umbrella for trick-or-treating or even taking shelter indoors. Farther north, he said rain may dampen festivities in parts of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region, including in Detroit and Cleveland. However, according to the Storm Prediction Center, the threat for severe weather appears ""marginal"" as of Monday. While portions of the central U.S. dodge raindrops, the main weather story for folks along the Eastern Seaboard will be the unusual, potential record-breaking warmth. How warm? High temperatures Thursday are expected to range from the 70s in New England to near 80 degrees across much of the Mid-Atlantic, AccuWeather predicts. According to Kaiser, ""h​igh temperatures could approach daily records in some Northeast cities, including Albany, New York, Hartford, Connecticut, and Trenton, New Jersey."" The Southeast will see above-average warmth as well: ""People may need to bring fans with them in Raleigh and Charlotte as temperatures will start in the 80s for trick-or-treating and fall back into the 70s,"" Pastelok said. The dreariest, chilliest spot on Halloween night is likely to be the Pacific Northwest, where rain or even high-elevation snow is possible, AccuWeather said rain and cool temperatures from a sweeping cold front could produce a double whammy in Seattle and Portland, forcing some costumes under jackets. Snow is even possible in the mountains: ""The higher elevations in the Northwest, above 2,000 feet, can experience some tricks from Mother Nature with wintry conditions,"" Pastelok said. In the Southwest, AccuWeather says there will be no weather-related concerns as kids and adults fill the neighborhood streets.",https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/28/halloween-weather-2024-forecast/75891949007/
"3 dead, 3 injured in shootings at Minneapolis homeless encampments: 'Cold-blooded killing'","Minneapolis police are investigating back-to-back fatal shootings over the weekend involving a half-dozen people at two separate homeless encampments in the city. As of Monday, no arrests had been made in the shootings that left a combined three people dead and a fourth person clinging to life. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey tied the shooting and other recent violence at encampments to the drug fentanyl. The Minneapolis Police Department reported the first shooting took place Saturday just before 4:45 a.m., at a homeless encampment about two miles southeast of downtown. At the scene, the agency wrote in a release, officers located three men injured by gunfire. The victims were transported to a local hospital where one of the men, age 31, died, police said. On Monday, police Sgt. Garrett Parten told USA TODAY the other two victims' conditions were not immediately known. Homicide investigators said they were investigating what led up to the shooting, including the possibility that three suspects who left the scene on foot. Investigators were also working to determine ""what connection the three injured men had with the encampment,"" police wrote in a release. As of Monday morning, the suspects had not been located. 'Home Improvement' star: Zachery Ty Bryan charged with DUI in Oklahoma The second shooting took place the next day in broad daylight at another encampment along railroad tracks five miles southeast of downtown, police said. That camp is about three-and-half miles southeast of the scene of the first triple shooting. During that shooting, which took place about 2:20 p.m., unknown suspects shot three people in the camp − two men and one woman. The men, age 32 and 38, were both pronounced dead at the scene. Parten said the woman was taken to a hospital to be treated for life-threatening injuries. On Sunday, police announced three people were detained after the second shooting, but were later cleared and released. They did not elaborate. Chief says police 'failed' victim: Minneapolis man accused of shooting neighbor arrested Police said they have not ruled out the possibility both shootings are related, and said the case − including a motive for the attacks − remained under investigation. “The cold-blooded killing of three people inside the tent of an encampment is outrageous,” police Chief Brian O’Hara released in a statement Sunday. “All human life matters and encampments are not safe."" The Hennepin County Medical Examiner will release the victims' identities and their official cause and manner of death, police said. USA TODAY has reached out to the medical examiner's office. During a Sunday press conference, Frey said Minneapolis has seen an increase in homicides and shootings around homeless encampments across the city. ""This is another incredibly tragic and situation... it's not a coincidence this happened at homeless encampments,"" Frey said. ""We need to call a spade a spade. This is not about a lack of shelter... the issues that we're seeing in terms of crime and violence (are) about fentanyl."" The drug, a potential deadly narcotic, is a synthetic opioid approved for treating pain often laced into cocaine and other illicit recreational drugs. In cases where a mixture of fentanyl and cocaine isn’t fatal, it could increase the likelihood that the user develops an addiction. Drug dealers use fentanyl as a cheap way to amp up the power of other drugs, Tom Doub, chief clinical and compliance officer at addiction treatment company American Addiction Centers, previously told The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network. The drugs are cheap to make, which means they are cheaper to buy on the street. Minneapolis City Council Member Jason Chavez pushed back on Frey tying the violence to fentanyl, local media outlet KARE 11 reported, accusing the mayor of pushing blame onto the city council. 'We are seeing folks that get evicted from their rental units end up in shelters or at encampments. That is not a fentanyl issue,"" Chavez said, per the outlet, while calling for a ""housing-first model."" ""If you can move someone into a tiny home with services, with mental health support, addiction services, an opportunity to have a job and a place to sleep at night, the likelihood that they're going to move into a permanent place and be stable has increased. That model works. Let's do more of that in the city of Minneapolis,"" Chavez said, per KARE 11. O'Hara said the department continues to address crime related issues associated with homeless encampments and the city continues to offer resources. ""To help end this cycle of violence that is exacerbated by narcotics and mental health issues, it is crucial that the residents of these encampments accept the resourced that are available,"" O'Hara said.

Weather extremes in the forecast this week: What to expect from coast-to-coast,"Weather extremes are forecast from coast-to-coast this week as a cold front moves inland off the Pacific and a bout of potentially record-breaking heat spreads eastward, producing strong thunderstorms in the central U.S. as the temperatures clash, meteorologists say. Soaring temperatures could break decades-old temperature records early this week from Texas to Minnesota and Michigan as temperatures rise 15-25 degrees above their historical averages, according to AccuWeather. Widespread afternoon temperatures will be in the 70s and 80s, with some south-central states potentially reaching 90 degrees. The warm weather is projected to spread east by Wednesday, ratcheting up daily highs to potentially record levels throughout the Mid-Atlantic region and elevating the risk of wildfires. On Halloween, daily record temperatures – some dating back to the 1940s and 1950s – could be broken in major Northeast cities, including Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and New York City, according to AccuWeather. A factor in the east's rising temperatures is a lack of rainfall, which is on pace to make October the driest month on record in Philadelphia and New York City, neither of which has received measurable amounts of rainfall since September. The dry conditions combined with gusty winds approaching from the west will lead to a sustained risk of wildfires across the Northeast, prompting warnings from meteorologists. ""This time of year, many people are doing yardwork and burning leaves and other smaller twigs or perhaps having evening bonfires with family and friends. Extra precautions will need to be taken when participating in these kinds of activities due to the high fire danger and how quickly fires could spread,"" said Dan Pydynowski, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather. ""It may be best to put off burning leaves and other yard waste until a change in the pattern brings wetter conditions with less wind."" As heat expands east, a cold front blowing in from the Rockies will alleviate high temperatures in the central U.S. but is expected to cause thunderstorms capable of flooding low-lying areas. The risk of storm outbreak will peak on Tuesday night across the south-central Plains and Upper Midwest, where ""strong to severe thunderstorms"" could produce damaging winds and hail, according to the National Weather Service. Through Wednesday and Thursday, forecasters expect rain to scuttle Halloween festivities in parts of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region, including major cities such as Detroit and Cleveland, according to AccuWeather. Thunderstorms may hamper holiday plans in the South, especially a swath of the region from Houston to Little Rock, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee. Rain is also forecast across the eastern coast of the Florida Peninsula, from Daytona to Miami and the Florida Keys. Though the rain could cause flooding, damaging winds and hail are the main hazards through the midweek, meteorologists said. Beginning over the weekend, a series of storms pushing across the Northwest from the Pacific began to unload cool air, rain, strong winds and, at high elevations, snow. On Monday, showers and thunderstorms are expected along the Pacific coasts of Oregon and Washington, where there is a possibility of ""localized flooding, mainly in low-lying and poor drainage areas,"" according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Alyssa Glenny. The rain will extend into Tuesday across the Pacific Northwest and Northern California, the weather service said. As the storms roll into the interior states, they will trigger snowfall across the high terrain of Utah, Wyoming and Colorado, AccuWeather said. Snow amounts could exceed half a foot across the central Rockies. The cool air will bring relief to some western states. In Las Vegas, which has sweltered in recent days amid afternoon highs in the 80s, the storms are projected to drop temperatures into the 60s this week.",https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/28/weekly-weather-forecast-record-heat-snow-thunderstorms/75889880007/

"1 dead, 1 critically injured after passengers were reportedly subway surfing in NYC","New York police are investigating after two passengers who were subway surfing Sunday fell between train cars, leaving 1 dead and 1 hospitalized. A person called the NYPD about the incident around 10:48 p.m. Sunday, the NYPD's Office of the Deputy Commissioner said Monday morning. The caller said a person had been hit by a train at the 111th Street subway station, part of the 115th Precinct, which includes a northern portion of Queens. According to the Office of the Deputy Commissioner, the southbound ""7"" train hit the female passengers. The office did not announce the ages of the passengers, but local television stations WNYW and WABC reported that they were teenagers. One of the passengers was pronounced dead at the scene while the other was taken to a hospital with trauma to the head, the Office of the Deputy Commissioner confirmed to USA TODAY. The second passenger was listed as being in critical condition. The girls got on the subway at the Flushing Main St. station, WABC reported, and were reportedly subway surfing, a trend where people ride on top of train cars. They were running on top of a moving subway as it headed west and had jumped between train cars. When the train stopped, the girls lost their balance and one of the girls fell under the train, the outlet reported. She also suffered a brain bleed, according to WABC. The outlet said the girls weren’t carrying identification, so police haven’t been able to notify their families. The identity of the deceased is pending at this time, the Office of the Deputy Commissioner said. Last year, five people died while subway surfing, reported WABC. The girl’s death is the sixth subway surfing death this year, according to WABC. Last week, a 13-year-old boy fell and died while subway surfing at the Forest Avenue subway station in Queens. The following day, a 20-year-old man died under similar circumstances, reported WNBC. Contributing: Saman Shafiq, USA TODAY Saleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

Minneapolis man accused of shooting neighbor arrested; chief says police 'failed' victim,"A Minnesota man suspected of shooting his neighbor while he was cutting a tree was arrested and charged early Monday morning. His neighbor reported him to police several times before the shooting, officials say. The suspect, John Herbert Sawchak, 54, is believed to have shot his neighbor, Davis Moturi, on Oct. 23 from inside his Minneapolis home while the victim was cutting a tree. The victim reported Sawchak several times before, including after Sawchak is said to have threatened to shoot the victim if he touched the same tree he was cutting when Wednesday's shooting occurred, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara. When Moturi's wife got home, she believed her husband had suffered from a heart attack and Emergency Medical Services transported him to the hospital, O’Hara said during a press briefing Friday. There, medical personnel discovered he'd been shot. The victim could not remember what happened before he was found unconscious, including that fact that he was shot, O'Hara said. No witnesses were around at the time of the shooting. USA TODAY reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department. Sergeant Garrett Parten confirmed the victim's name and directed USA TODAY to the press briefing on YouTube for the latest information. Florida murder: Palm Beach County man, 21, faces murder charge in failed drug deal Sawchak was arrested peacefully Monday morning after a SWAT operation that lasted several hours. ""Minneapolis Police exhausted all of our efforts to peacefully bring the situation to resolution (prior) to escalating the use of force with a SWAT team and special tactics,"" said O'Hara. Sawchak was charged with the following felonies, according to the Hennepin County Sheriff's Department: The suspect is being held on a $1 million bail and is set to a court appearance on Tuesday at 1:30 p.m., according to the department's arrest records. The victim had also reported his neighbor several times before the shooting and made several 911 calls regarding Sawchak. He also reported his neighbor before when he threatened to shoot him if he touched a specific tree, according to O’Hara. ""We failed this victim,"" O’Hara said Sunday night. ""He should not have been shot."" When police responded to the calls, Sawchak refused to open the door and speak with officers, according to O’Hara. A lieutenant had gone to the suspect's house over 20 times. The number does not include the times other officers have been called to the address. This led to the lieutenant giving his phone number to the victim, said O’Hara. The lieutenant asked the victim to call him when he did see Sawchak leave his home. Before Sunday night, police had concerns over an altercation and wanted to arrest the suspect where he did not have access to his firearms, but O'Hara said the man was a ""recluse"" and did not leave his house often. The suspect, who O'Hara said was ""mentally ill,"" was known to possess firearms, had violent confrontations in the past and refused to cooperate in ""the dozens of times that police officers have responded to the residence."" The execution of the arrest warrant was deemed ""high-risk."" ""Based on our assessment, the likelihood of an armed, violent confrontation where we may have to use deadly force with the suspect in this case is high,"" said O'Hara during a press briefing on Friday. ""Prior to Wednesday, all we had was a threats warrant.""",https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2024/10/28/minneapolis-police-arrest-john-herbert-sawchak-shooting-neighbor-tree/75889846007/
