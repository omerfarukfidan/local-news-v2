10,Jeff Bezos defends Washington Post non-endorsement after subscribers flee and staffers resign,"The Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, in his first public comments sinceigniting uproarlast week over his decision to withhold the venerable newspaper’s endorsement in the presidential race, defended the move ina rare op-edpublished Monday evening by the Post. “Presidential endorsements do nothing to tip the scales of an election,” Bezos, the billionaire Amazon founder, wrote. “No undecided voters in Pennsylvania are going to say, ‘I’m going with Newspaper A’s endorsement.’ None. What presidential endorsements actually do is create a perception of bias. A perception of non-independence. Ending them is a principled decision, and it’s the right one.” The statement came hours after three members of the Post’s editorial boardresigned over the decisionnot to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris and thousands of readers canceled their subscriptions to the newspaper. High-profile Post staffers have also publicly expressed their dismay over how the situation was handled and raised questions over the reason for the eleventh-hour decision. Critics, including former Post executive editor Marty Baron, have called the decision “craven” and “cowardly” in a clear attempt to appease former President Donald Trump, should he recapture the White House in November. A person with knowledge of the matter told CNN that an endorsement of Harrishad been draftedby the Post’s editorial board members before it was quashed by Bezos. “I wish we had made the change earlier than we did, in a moment further from the election and the emotions around it,” Bezos acknowledged about the decision not to endorse. “That was inadequate planning, and not some intentional strategy.” On Friday, in the hours after Post publisher Will Lewis announced the decision not to make an endorsement, Trump met with executives from Blue Origin, a Bezos-founded spacefaring company. In his op-ed, Bezos deniedallegations hewithheld the endorsement to curry favor with Trump, saying he had no advance knowledge of the meeting. “I would also like to be clear that no quid pro quo of any kind is at work here. Neither campaign nor candidate was consulted or informed at any level or in any way about this decision. It was made entirely internally,” he wrote. Bezos said he “sighed” when he found out about the meeting between Trump and Blue Origin chief executive Dave Limp, “because I knew it would provide ammunition to those who would like to frame this as anything other than a principled decision. But the fact is, I didn’t know about the meeting beforehand.” He emphasized there was “no connection” between the meeting and the Post’s decision, calling speculation to the contrary “false.” Bezos, however, acknowledged the “appearance of conflict,” noting that his work across Amazon and Blue Origin has been a “complexifier for the Post.” Despite this, he brushed aside the notion that his immense wealth could lead to political favors, instead calling his billions “a bulwark against intimidation” and underscoring his lack of interference in the Post’s affairs in the 11 years since he purchased the publication. “While I do not and will not push my personal interest, I will also not allow this paper to stay on autopilot and fade into irrelevance — overtaken by unresearched podcasts and social media barbs — not without a fight. It’s too important,” he wrote. “The stakes are too high.” But Bezos’s comments come after days of widespread backlash and turmoil inside of his newspaper, including public criticism from Watergate reporting legends Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward, and anopen statementsigned by nearly two dozen Post columnists. “The Washington Post’s decision not to make an endorsement in the presidential campaign is a terrible mistake,” the columnists wrote. “It represents an abandonment of the fundamental editorial convictions of the newspaper that we love.” David Hoffman, who was awarded the 2024 Pulitzer Prize in Editorial Writing for a series on the new tactics authoritarian regimes use to repress dissent, stepped down from his editorial board position Monday, telling CNN in an interview he did not want to remain silent about the threat Trump poses to the country. “I cannot sit here any longer on the editorial board and write those editorials while we ourselves have given in to silence,” he said. “We face a terrible, terrible choice, I believe, a looming autocracy. I don’t want to be silent about it. I don’t want the Post to be silent about it, and the fact that we’re not going to endorse is a degree of silence I can’t stand.” Baron, the Post’s former editor who led the paper to a Pulitzer for its coverage of the January 6 attack, also questioned that the decision to end presidential endorsements was a matter of principle. “If their philosophy is readers can make up their own minds on the big issues that they face in this democracy, then don’t run any editorials,” Baron told CNN’s Michael Smerconish. “But the fact is they only decided not to run an editorial in this one instance 11 days before the election.” CNN’s Hadas Gold contributed reporting.",Washington
11,The Philippines is prone to extreme weather. But few expected Tropical Storm Trami to be this devastating,"Water was already up to his knees, but 22-year-old Kierwen Garlan’s first thought was how to help his neighbors, as their homes were filling with floodwater and being lashed by heavy rain. Tropical Storm Trami, known locally as Kristine, swept across the northeastern Philippines last week, inundating entire towns with severe flooding and triggering deadly landslides in what was the deadliest and most destructive storm to hit the archipelago so far this year. The Philippines is struck by multiple typhoons a year and Trami was not an especially strong storm when it made landfall, at least in terms of windspeed. But it was the intense downpours that brought destruction. Nearly 130 people have been killed and at least 30 are missing, the country’s disaster relief agency said, as authorities race to deliver relief to remote communities, particularly those in the hardest hit Bicol region, ahead of another powerful storm that could soon lash the region again. “Of course, we were scared, but luckily my family’s house is on higher ground,” Garlan, a resident of Sorsogon province, told CNN. Raging floodwaters covered the rooftops of several homes in the district of Bulan, Sorsogon – over 575 kilometers southeast of the capital Manila. “There were heavy rains and strong winds that came so suddenly,” Garlan said. “And our town normally doesn’t get flooded.” As soon as the rains started to weaken, Garland and about 15 volunteers teamed up with local rescue authorities to clear up roads and arrange for the delivery of aid. “We’re worried we won’t get to people in time. There are already children getting colds and coughs, maybe some are also contracting leptospirosis (a bacterial disease),” he said. Bulan, a town of about 100,000 people, was among the first municipality to declare a state of emergency on Wednesday in anticipation of the storm. It quickly got swept by floods, but luckily, no deaths have been reported. Across Sorsogon province, pictures shared by emergency response teams showed thick mud blanketing many roads making some parts inaccessible to vehicles. The death toll around the country continues to rise as blocked roads, choppy waters and strong winds hamper rescue operations and make it risky to reach rural areas by land, sea and air. Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos ordered Philippine army assets, including his presidential helicopter, to assist in relief and rescue efforts, according to astatementon Friday. “By air, land, or sea, we’ll keep the support coming. Together, we will rise again,” Marcos said. Talisay in Batangas province, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of Manila, was one of the worst-hit towns ravaged by Trami. Residents in the rural lakeside town are accustomed to disaster, as it sits north of the Taal volcano, one of the country’s most active, which regularly sends plumes of ash in the air and people heed to evacuations. But no one seemed prepared for the unusually high rainfall brought on from Trami. Entire families were trapped in the deluge of mudslides and nearly 3,000 homes across the province destroyed. The provincial governor, Hermilando Mandanas, advised families of the deceased to immediately bury those killed, fearing that another potentially powerful storm, Typhoon Kong-Rey, also known locally as Leon, could soon lash the region again. A funeral was held on Saturday in the small town’s covered basketball court for the 20 people, including 12 children, who died from landslides, according to local authorities in Talisay. Raynaldo Dejucos lost all his family members – the youngest among them a two-year-old child – after a landslide engulfed their home in the town, state-run PTVreported. “I’m trying to stay strong,” Dejucos told PTV. “I can never forget this… I don’t know how long it will take to heal.” “When I got there, everything was gone. No home, and everywhere there were rocks, mud and scrap pieces of metal sheets were left. Not a single house was left.” A two-year-old girl was rescued, but all four of her direct family members were killed, leaving her an orphan, PTV reported. In nearby Albay province, Heinrich Sandrino said that although authorities managed to evacuate those living in vulnerable areas in his town, they were still caught off guard by the extreme volume of rain. Sandrino said the flood brought in sand, which covered the streets and buried half of the houses and vehicles, making it nearly impossible to dispatch rescuers. Marcos visited Bicol’s largest province, Camarines Sur, on Saturday to inspect the damage and met with some victims sheltering at an evacuation center. “Our main problem here is that many areas are still flooded,” he told government officials during a briefing, saying “the amount of water is unmanageable.” “This is climate change. This is all new, so we have to come up with new solutions too,” Marcos added. Marcos stressed the need to revisit long-term development projects, particularly the Bicol River Basin Project, to address severe flooding during weather disasters. On Monday, Trami continued moving west across the South China Sea from the Philippines, lashing central Vietnam, where it killed at least two in the central province of Thua Thien Hue,state media reported. The region is also bracing for Kong Rey, which has now hit typhoon strength, as it hurdles towards Taiwan this week, bringing heavy rains and strong winds to the Philippines’ northern Luzon island over the next few days. Southeast Asia is one of the most climate vulnerable regions of the world, experts warn, making it more susceptible to extreme weather likeheatwaves, storm surges and floods. The Philippines, a nation highly susceptible to natural disasters, has seen an increasing number of storms and typhoons with greater severity in recent years. So far this year, its capital Manila and parts of Luzon have seen devastating flooding as a result ofTyphoon Gaemi. Last month, the country was also hit by the region’s most powerful storm this year,Typhoon Yagi, which left dozens dead after sweeping across southern China and Southeast Asia.",Global
12,Elon Musk is sharing some details about his immigration path. Experts say they still have questions,"It’s rare to hear Elon Musk discuss the details of his own immigration journey. But the billionaire tech tycoon opened up about some of it over the weekend in a series of posts on the platform he owns, X, hours after theWashington Post reportedthat Musk began his career working illegally in the US when he was building a Silicon Valley startup in the 1990s. The newspaper’s story cited court records, company documents and former business associates, including a past CEO of the company who said investors had worried that Musk could be deported. Musk hasn’t responded to CNN’s requests for comment on the report. He also hasn’t responded to CNN’s requests for comment about remarks he once madedescribing his past immigration status as a “gray area.” In a post on X, where video circulated of President Biden referencing the Washington Post report’s claims, Musk denied that he’d worked without authorization. “I was in fact allowed to work in the US,”Musk wrote, accusing Biden of lying. The newspaper’s report and Biden’s remarks circulated widely among critics of Musk, some of whom accused the world’s richest man of having a double standard given how much time he’s devoted to slamming illegal immigration in the runup to the 2024 presidential election. Supporters of Musk,including Tesla fan accounts, also swiftly rose to his defense andcriticized Biden. In response to one such post, Musk described two visas he once had — offering more detail than he’d previously shared publicly. “I was on a J-1 visa that transitioned to an H1-B,” Musk wrote. “They know this, as they have all my records. Losing the election is making them desperate.” But experts told CNN those details raise additional questions Musk hasn’t answered. TheJ-1 visais for exchange visitors and can be used for foreign students to pursue academic training or research. It requires asponsoring program, such as a university. AnH-1Bis a temporary employment visa for specialty occupations. Musk didn’t detail what institution sponsored his J-1 visa,or which years he had the visa. Musk was born in South Africa, obtained Canadian citizenship through his mother and came to the US to study at the University of Pennsylvania in 1992. He became a US citizen a decade later, according to biographies of the billionaire. He has said in the past that after leaving Penn he had planned to pursue graduate studies at Stanford, butdropped outto work on founding his first company. That’s significant, experts say, because there are strict rules about the kind of work allowed when someone is in the US on a student visa, and work authorizations tied to student visas generally require someone to be actively studying or for the sponsoring institution to allow the student to get academic or practical training after graduation. Immigration attorney Greg Siskind, who’s co-authored multiple editions of a guide to J-1 visas, says transitioning from a J-1 visa to an H-1B visa is a possible path. But he says a J-1 visa wouldn’t provide work authorization to someone who dropped out of a degree program. The moment Musk dropped out, he would have lost his status and been unauthorized to work, Siskind says. “Musk would have needed to be engaged in a full course of study (at least 12 academic hours a semester) in order to qualify for work while being a J-1 student,” Siskindwrote on X. A Stanford spokeswoman told CNN last month that the university had no record Musk had ever enrolled there, but that he had been accepted into the school’s Materials Science and Engineering graduate program. Asked if Musk ever had a student visa connected with the university, the spokeswoman said she did not know because further documentation was unavailable. What if Musk’s visa was obtained through the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied as an undergraduate? The same criteria would apply, Siskind says. And given Musk’s background, Siskind says it’s unlikely he would have been eligible for humanitarian exceptions sometimes granted to allow off-campus work due to economic hardship. Atlanta immigration attorney Charles Kuck says Musk stating that he had a J-1 visa makes it clear he worked illegally, given therestrictionsthat would have only allowed work in connection with his academic program. “So clearly, he’s admitting now that in fact, he did work illegally and violate his status. The only question is at that point, what did he do to fix his status violation?” Kuck says. Working illegally isn’t a crime, Kuck says, but having done so would require certain steps to be taken to return to a legal immigration status. Key unanswered questions, Kuck says, are what steps Musk took to get his H-1B visa, and when that occurred. Musk graduated from Penn in May 1997, according to a university spokesman. Biographies of the SpaceX and Tesla CEO indicate he finished his studies there in 1995. According to the Post’s report, a 1996 funding agreement with venture capitalists who’d agreed to contribute $3 million to Musk’s first company “stated that the Musk brothers and an associate had 45 days to obtain legal work status. Otherwise, the firm could reclaim its investment.” Musk had told coworkers that he was in the country on a student visa, six former associates and shareholders in the company told the Post. “Student visas are some of the most complicated visas out there, and work related to them is also extraordinarily complicated. And to dismiss it in a in a two-line tweet, ‘Well I had a J-1 and it went to H-1B,’ yeah, trust me, there’s always a lot more to it than that,” Kuck says. Musk is an increasingly powerful force shaping and amplifying conversations around immigration — especially since his 2022 takeover of Twitter, now known as X, and given his huge audience on the platform. His more than 200 million followers on X frequently see him sharing postsendorsing conspiracy theoriesthat claim the Biden administration has deliberately allowed undocumented immigrants to cross the border to gain political advantage. It’s also common to see posts referring to his own background as an immigrant and advocating for increased legal immigration to the US. In response to details his mother, Maye Musk,has shared on Xabouther own immigration journey, Elon Musk has called legal immigration to the US “a laborious Kafkaesque nightmare” and noted that becoming a US citizen “was extremely difficultand took over a decade.” But he’s offered few specifics about his immigration status in the early days of his career, when he and his brother were founding their early online city guide and mapping tool that was later dubbed Zip2. His brother, Kimbal Musk, has repeatedly stated that early investors in their company soon learned they were “illegal immigrants,” but Elon Musk has disputed his brother’s characterization. “I’d say it was a gray area,” Elon Musk said at a 2013 event. And in a 2020 podcast interview, Elon Musk said he had a “student work visa” at the time. “Student work visa” is not an official term, and experts told CNN last month that it’s impossible to know Musk’s immigration path without access to the paper trail in his government file. It’s likely regulations weren’t enforced as strictly during Musk’s time as a student, according to Hunter Swanson, associate director of the Center for International Education at Washington and Lee University in Virginia. Enforcement of student visa restrictions, and thesystems officials use to monitor compliance, intensified dramatically after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, Swanson told CNN earlier this year. Some of thehijackers involvedin the attacks were in the U.S. on student visas, according to the official 9/11 Commission Report. “It definitely wouldn’t be possible to do academic training now on a J-1 Visa if you dropped out in your first term,” Swanson said in an email Sunday. What’s the importance of digging into Musk’s own immigration history? “For me, it’s the hypocrisy,” Siskind says.”He’s been fixated on illegal immigration in the last year. And you know, he should be empathetic to the people who are struggling with the immigration system.”",Global
13,Decades in a country he can’t call home: South Korean’s US adoption nightmare,"Adam Crapser has become something of a cause celebre for what critics say is a flawed United States law thatunfairly leaves tens of thousands of international adopteesin limbo without citizenship. Eight years after he was deported from the US – his home for decades – Crapser was in a Seoul courtroom on Wednesday, suing for restitution on what he called a flawed adoption process that has made a shambles of his life. As a bill in Congress that could bring the 49-year-old back to the US waits in committee, Crapser’s case puts a spotlight on an international adoption system loophole – one that has torn some families apart. “What about my kids? Don’t they deserve a home?” Crapser told CNN Friday, referring to the two children he was forced to leave behind, including his 10-year-old daughter. “I wanted to be with her. I wanted to raise her. I wanted to be in her life. I wanted to be her father. I wanted to do everything that I could to give her a life that I didn’t have,” Crapser said. “I want her to know definitively that since all of this started — before she was born — that I have been fighting this.” Crapser was adopted by a Michigan family in 1979 and lived in the US for 37 years. His American family and guardians, however, failed to secure the paperwork for his citizenship and he was deported after alengthy legal battlein 2016. “I’m stuck. I’ve been in between like this for a significant amount of time,” Crapser said of his desire to return to his family and the uncertainty of his future. Crapser made history as the first Korean adoptee to sue the South Korean government and his adoption agency for damages in 2019. As he awaits a court decision in Seoul, a bill that could grant him US citizenship remains stalled in Congress. The proposed bill, theAdoptee Citizenship Act of 2024, aims to grant automatic citizenship to international adoptees and rectify the loophole in the Child Citizenship Act of 2000, which excluded those who were 18 or older at the time the law was enacted. Crapser, who was 25 when the law was passed, did not gain US citizenship. Crapser remains skeptical about the passage of the new bill, pointing out that it “probably” may not happen “in our lifetimes,” based on the lack of progress since discussions of therecently introduced legislation began in 2017. A spokesperson for Democratic Rep. Adam Smith of Washington, one of the co-sponsors of the legislation, said, “While it’s unlikely that we’ll see more movement in the rest of the 118th Congress” — which ends in January 2025 — “given the election and the lame-duck period we’re expecting, we are hopeful that this very necessary bill progresses in future Congresses to become law.” The bill has been referred to the Senate and House Judiciary Committees for review. Republican Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, another co-sponsor and afather to two adopted children, said in a statement to CNN, “There are folks who have always thought of themselves as citizens and should be. But due to a quirk in the current law, some international adoptees are not citizens. Congress needs to fix.” After being abandoned by his initial adoptive parents in the 1980s, Crapser moved between foster homes and care facilities, according to a 2023 court case in the Seoul Central District Court. In 1989, he was adopted by another couple, who were prosecuted in 1991 for charges of physical abuse and assault against foster and adopted children and found guilty in 1992. Around 2012, when Crapser applied for the renewal of his expired permanent residency – commonly known as a “green card” – his criminal record, including charges of burglary and assault, drew the attention of US immigration officials, according to the court case. “It’s been said a lot that I made a lot of mistakes and I got into a lot of trouble in the United States, and I admit that,” Crapser said during testimony Wednesday,according to the Associated Press.“I survived the best that I could in the United States, without a family and without any Korean people around me.” The criminal record was deemed a violation of his green card status, and in 2016 he lost his fight against deportation back to South Korea, where he was born — but a place where he didn’t know the language or customs. “It’s a bad dream. Other people who come to Korea by their own volition, planned it to some extent. You don’t get to do any of that when you go to immigration prison,” he told CNN, expressing the systematic lack of support he had to prepare for his forced return. An attorney for Crapserpreviously told CNNthat his criminal history does not reflect the full reality of his experiences, which included suffering physical abuse and abandonment by his first adoptive parents, only to face further mistreatment in his subsequent adoption – stressing the vulnerabilities of many adoptees. Having grown up with no exposure to Koreans, he says he grapples with a sense of disconnect from the place he is expected to call home. “I don’t have any choice,” Crapser said. “All I know is American culture. I didn’t know anything about Korean customs, cultures, rules, history, or anything because it was intentionally kept from me.” On Wednesday, Crapser denounced both his South Korean adoption agency and the government during his appeals court session in Seoul, he told CNN. Despite his 10-year-ban on returning to the US, he said he’s pursued legal avenues to be with his children. He has not seen his 10-year-old daughter since 2017. “I’ve literally tried every single legal remedy to try and get back to the United States earlier so I could be in my child’s life, and that has not been successful,” he said. Crapser can file for waivers in two years, he says, but remains uncertain about how long that legislative process will take. Attempting to return to the US beforehand could result in a lifetime ban. “I want to make sure that there’s a historical record, not only for my children, but also for the history of adoption that this has to do with other countries where they failed to ensure the children receive naturalization in the receiving countries,” he added. CNN reached out to the adoption agency, Holt Children’s Services, for comment but did not immediately receive a response. In response to recent media reports about adoptions from South Korea in the 1980s, Holt International acknowledged the potential unethical practicesin a public statementand noted Holt Children’s Services separated from Holt International in 1977. “These reports highlight serious concerns, and we do not take these concerns lightly or dismiss the fact that mistakes were likely made,” Holt said in the statement. Last year, a lower Korean court ruled that Holt must pay Crapser 100 million won ($72,300) in damages for not informing his US adoptive parents about the steps required to secure his citizenship following the completion of his adoption in a US state court, according to the lawsuit. However, the Seoul Central District Court rejected Crapser’s additional claims against Holt and cleared the government of liability. Both Crapser and Holt filed appeals, with Holt asserting that it bore no legal obligation to ensure Crapser obtained his citizenship,the AP reported. An attorney for the government stated that officials at that time had no legal obligation to confirm the citizenship status of adoptees and found no clear reason to question the accuracy of Crapser’s paperwork,according to the AP. The Seoul High Court is set to render its decision on January 8 regarding Crapser’s seeking of monetary damages.",Global
14,What looking like Timothée Chalamet taught me about fame,"We’d been on the road by 2 a.m., and after a missed flight and a seven-hour drive from upstate New York, I was finally in the city. I was with my girlfriend, one of the few people — alongside my parents and a handful of friends — who knew what I was about to do. I wasn’t scheduled to work at my job at a fishing store (where I sell bait and tackle, and keep moored boats topped up with gas) this weekend. For that I’m grateful, because I’m not sure how I’d have explained the situation to my boss otherwise. How do I ask for time off to enter a Timothée Chalamet lookalike contest? I saw the competition flier on the internet a few weeks ago and thought it could be fun. My girlfriend is a huge Chalamet fan, and was excited by the whole idea. So, I registered as a contestant and posted a selfie to the organizers — all that was needed to enter — just as a joke. I wasn’t sure if the Manhattan event was even real or not. But as it became apparent that it was legit, I bought a plane ticket. It didn’t cost much, with transport and a couple of nights stay coming to around $400. After all, this may be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I wasn’t nervous. If anything, I was pumped. I’ve been thinking of moving to New York City for a while — hopefully once I finish studying graphics and multimedia marketing at the State University of New York Canton (SUNY) — so this felt like a good opportunity. I want to do something creative, like making clothes, shooting videos or modeling, so I reasoned that the event could be a good networking opportunity. That’s how people get jobs isn’t it? Through connections? The Chalamet comparisons began earlier this year when I grew out my dark, curly hair. People have joked under Instagram posts that they liked me in “Dune 2.” I get looks from passersby on the street and a work colleague calls me Willy Wonka. Friends make jokes about the likeness, too. But the weirdest moment happened last winter, when I went to Toronto with my girlfriend during the holidays. We were in a mall and saw a “Wonka” pop-up with giant posters and a huge pink “chocolate” tree, just like the one from the movie. I wasn’t standing there long when a guy working at the pop-up ran over to me. “I’ve seen so many people come through here, and you’re the only one who looks like Timothée. You should sign your name next to his!” he said, pointing to Chalamet’s signature on one of the posters. I immediately felt like an imposter. “I can’t sign that,” I told him. Disappointed, he insisted I take a picture in the photo shoot area. Before I could say no, he and his colleagues rushed over holding a Wonka-style coat and snapped a picture. I still have that photo. It’s funny to think I felt awkward posing for that picture, and yet I was traveling to an event where people take hundreds or even thousands more like it. When I got to Washington Square Park in Manhattan on Sunday, half an hour before the contest was due to begin, there were already at least 1,000 people in the crowd. For a while, all I could see were phone screens — people recording me, taking my picture and asking to speak to me. At first it was overwhelming. I felt hounded by the TV cameras and journalists, as if I were an animal in the zoo or a circus. I was scared that contestants would be asked to perform or walk in front of all these people. I heard some boos and cheers at the other end of the park (I later saw online that it was the crowd judging other contestants), but I stayed under the Washington Square Arch. I met a few other lookalikes and we stuck together amid the pandemonium. The NYPD issued a dispersal order and, at one point, an officer approached me and screamed that I needed to leave the park. I ignored him and moved away, but I saw another contestant get handcuffed and dragged out of the area. (The NYPD has since confirmed that it fined organizers $500 for an “unpermitted costume contest,” and at least one contestant was taken away in handcuffs, though a police spokesperson told the Associated Press that charges are pending.) Whenthe real Timothée Chalamet made a surprise appearance, the energy intensified. He was gone in a flash, however, disappearing through the crowd and heading back to a car on the outskirts of the park. I think he knew things would have escalated if he’d stayed too long. I had planned my outfit earlier in the week: A gray T-shirt, black leather jacket, ankle boots and straight-leg jeans to make me look skinnier. I was trying to recreate Chalamet’s look from the Chanel perfume campaign he starred in this summer. Some of the other Timothée’s, including the winner, dressed up as Willy Wonka. I didn’t get a good look at him, but I think they gave him the $50 prize (and a trophy) because he committed to the bit by giving out chocolate. I didn’t care about winning, but it was flattering when people later told me I should have taken first place. This will be my one and only lookalike competition. While I loved my three hours of fame (I have to admit, I felt a buzz from being “recognized”) it had its downsides. The stares, people pulling and touching you, photographing you. Luckily for me, as soon as it was over I could go and eat tacos with my girlfriend — no fans crowding the table, no disguises, no sneaky pictures being snapped from across the restaurant. Next week, I’ll go back to school and my job at the fishing store like nothing happened. And as much fun as it was to be Timothée Chalamet for an afternoon, I’m truly glad I’m Reed Putman.",Not Found
15,Colin Farrell finishes Dublin Marathon while pushing friend in a wheelchair,"Colin Farrelltook time out from his acting schedule on Sunday to complete theDublinMarathon – while pushing an old friend in a wheelchair. The 48-year-old star ran the final 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) of the 26-mile race while pushing his friend Emma Fogarty, who lives with a rare skin condition, across the finishing line. Farrell, who was back home in Ireland for the marathon, aimed to raise funds for DEBRA, an Irish charity supporting people who, like Fogarty, have the incurable genetic condition epidermolysis bullosa (EB) – also known as butterfly skin. Fogarty is Ireland’s oldest surviving person with the condition, according to the PA Media news agency, which saidshe was born with no skin on her left foot and right arm and can develop very painful blisters from even the slightest touch. She turned 40 in June – a milestone she thought she might not reach, having been born with the most severe form of the condition – which is why she and Farrell pledged to take part together, PA reported. Crowds roared their support as the Oscar-nominated actor, who is currently starring in the HBO miniseries “The Penguin,” met up with his friend in the late stage of the run on Sunday afternoon. (HBO, like CNN, is owned by Warner Bros. Discovery.) Farrell told PA: “I have known Emma for many years and she epitomises bravery, she is what courage and pure determination are all about.” The pair crossed the finish line just before 1 p.m. local time, with Farrell having completed the course in 4:06.45, according to PA. “That run was nothing compared to the pain she is forced to endure every single day, even though she doesn’t show it. “It was an honour to see her waiting for me with 4km to go, each of those representing a decade of her life, and to do the final stretch together. I’ll never forget it.” Also speaking to PA, Fogarty said: “This was a dream come true for me and I want to thank Colin, who has been the most supportive, generous and loyal friend I could wish for. “He has always shown his compassion and empathy for people living with EB and is a true champion in my eyes. “Running a marathon is never easy but once he committed to it there was no going back, he is a man of his word.” People living with EB do not have the essential proteins that bind the skin’s layers together, which means that even the most minor amount of friction or movement can cause the skin to break, tear or blister. Fogarty, who is an ambassador for DEBRA, has layers of bandages over 80% of her body to prevent wound infection. She and Farrell originally set out to raise €400,000 ($430,000) for the charity but now aim to hit the million-euro mark – and they are more than three-quarters of the way there, its website shows.

16,"Trump calls Harris a fascist, says he is ‘the opposite of a Nazi’","Donald Trump on Monday told supporters in Georgia he is “the opposite of a Nazi,” as he responded to comparisons of his Sunday rally atMadison Square Garden to a 1939 pro-Nazi gathering at the same venue. The former president also sought to turn criticism of his rally into a flashpoint for all Trump supporters by falsely claiming Vice President Kamala Harris is calling those who cast their ballots for him Nazis. “The newest line from Kamala and her campaign is that anyone who isn’t voting for her is a Nazi,” Trump told supporters at a rally in Georgia, a line that his Democratic rival has not actually said. Harris pounced last week afterThe Atlanticreported that Trump,while in the White House, had expressed admirationfor the loyalty of Adolf Hitler’s Nazi generals. That report was substantiated by retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, Trump’s chief of staff from 2017 to 2019, who separately told The New York Times that Trump fit the definition of a fascist. Harris responded tothose reports at a CNN town hall,saying she thinks Trump is a fascist and that “the people who know him best on this subject should be trusted.” Her campaign has also used The Atlantic’s report and Kelly’s remarks in advertisements in recent days. Trump seemed to be responding to those comments Monday night in Georgia, when he said his father had urged him never to describe people as Nazis or Hitler. “He used to always say: ‘Never use the word Nazi. Never use that word.’ And he’d say: ‘Never use the word Hitler. Don’t use that word,’” Trump said. Referring to Democrats, Trump added: “They use that word — really, it’s both words. ‘He’s Hitler.’ And then they say, ‘He’s a Nazi.’” “I’m not a Nazi,” Trump said. “I’m the opposite of a Nazi.” Trump also responded to Harris calling him a fascist by saying, “She’s a fascist, OK? She’s a fascist.” Trump’s description of Harris comes despite Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell days earlier calling the vice president’s use of the word “reckless” and claiming it could lead to violence. The attacks on Harris comeamid the political falloutof Trump’s Sunday rally at the iconic Madison Square Garden, wherea comedian opening for the former presidentcalled Puerto Rico a “floating island of garbage” — a comment that drew widespread condemnation and triggered backlash among a fast-growing Latino group in Pennsylvania. Harris on Monday told reporters the incendiary remarks at the Trump rally at Madison Square Garden were “not new” for a former president who regularly uses violent rhetoric targeting undocumented immigrants. “It is just more of the same, and maybe more vivid, than usual,” Harris said. “Donald Trump spends full time trying to have Americans point their finger at each other. He fans the fuel of hate and division, and that’s why people are exhausted with him.” Harris has not called Trump, or his supporters, Nazis. However, her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, on Sunday said there was “a direct parallel” between Trump’s wild Madison Square Garden rally and the notorious 1939 gathering of Nazi supporters at the landmark arena in New York City. “And don’t think that he doesn’t know for one second exactly what they’re doing there,” Walz said. Trump’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, complained Monday about that comparison. “They decided to compare us to literal Nazis for gathering in Madison Square Garden and celebrating the United States of America. These are the same people, of course, who call us racist for wanting to secure the southern border. They’re the same people who have no plans, no ideas and no solutions. All they have is hatred of their fellow citizens,” Vance said at a campaign stop in Wisconsin. Later, at another event, Vance argued that the values of American soldiers who stormed the beaches of Normandy to fight Nazi Germany in World War II are far from the policies Harris supports. “If you think those brave men were fighting for an open border and sex change surgeries for illegal aliens,” Vance said, “the proper term for you is ‘dipsh*t.’” CNN’s Kit Maher, Aaron Pellish, Nikki Carvajal, Michael Williams and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.",Global

The National Park service has amended the permit forVice President Kamala Harris’ speechat the Ellipse tonight to accommodate 40,000 participants, up from the original 20,000 expected to attend, according to a permit shared with CNN. Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said the department is “expecting upwards of about 52 thousand” participants in a presser on election security Tuesday morning. Harris’ speech, which will be given in the same park where former President Donald Trump spoke on January 6, 2021, will ask people to imagine who they want sitting in the Oval Office when a new president steps in – and where they want that person’s focus to be, she said in a pre-recorded interview with syndicated radio show “The Breakfast Club.” Vice President Kamala Harris on Tuesday dismissed pundits who say she doesn’t have strongelectoral support from Black men– saying she’d heard differently from many community leaders and alleging that idea came from a media “narrative.” She said “these men, these Black men” she spoke to were “talking about not only their support for me but most importantly their support from my perspective on what we can do that lifts up the community and taps into the ambitions, and the aspiration” At her recent rallies, Harris said the Black men in particular had told her, “Don’t you listen to that, and they got to stop with all the noise, we support you,” she also said she respected and understood the need to “earn their vote.” Harris said her poll numbers were actually good with Black men because “folks know I have a genuine commitment based on hard work that I have already done to lift up” the Black community – and attacked Donald Trump for his record with communities of color. “Donald Trump and Madison Square Garden, with all those tropes,” she said, her voice rising. “Donald Trump who took out a full-page ad in the New York Times for the Central Park Five, suggesting that these young black and brown – and they were not young men, they were children – should be executed. Donald Trump who, in New York as a landlord, refused to rent to black families. Donald Trump, who called the first black president – called him out and suggested he was not born in the United States and then, most recently, refers to Black Legal immigrants in Ohio, as though they’re eating their pets.” Vice President Kamala Harris admitted it was “disappointing” that owners of outlets like The Washington Post announced they would not endorse a presidential candidate in this election, but she also said it proves one of her closing campaign messages about former President Donald Trump. “It’s disappointing, no doubt,” the vice president said on radio show “The Breakfast Club” in an interview that aired Tuesday, “but the other piece of it is it gets back to my point about who is Donald Trump.” She said Trump’s policies are aimed at protecting the rich. “That’s why, when he was last president, he put in a place a massive tax cut for billionaires and the biggest corporations,” Harris said, “and that is exactly what he will do again.” Trump’s policies are “not about middle-class folks,” Harris said. Billionaire Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos, in his first public comments since igniting uproar last week over his decision to withhold the venerable newspaper’s endorsement in the presidential race, defended the move in a rare op-ed published Monday evening by the Post, asCNN reported late Monday. Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire entrepreneur and former mayor of New York City, has donated $50 million to entities supporting Vice President Kamala Harris, according to a person familiar with the matter. A longtime political juggernaut who launched afailed bid for the Democratic nominationin 2020, Bloomberg had given$19 million to support Biden’s candidacyin May but stopped short of endorsing Harris when she became the presumptive nominee. Harris’s economic team recently convened a meeting with Bloomberg, which covered a range of issues including tax policy, and the vice president called in to share her thoughts. CNN has reached out to representatives for Bloomberg for comment. The New York Times was the first to report Bloomberg’s contributions. CNN reported last week that Vice President Kamala Harrisplans to deliver a final-stretch closing argumentaddress Tuesday at the same location her rival delivered a fiery speech on January 6, 2021, that set in motion the attack by his supporters at the US Capitol. Harris’ speech Tuesday at the Ellipse, a park just outside the South Lawn of the White House, will amount to a high-profile denunciation of former President Donald Trump’s fitness for office and a warning about the chaos she says he would bring to the Oval Office should he win. Coming a week ahead of Election Day, Harris will use the major address to contrast her own vision of the presidency with her rival’s, painting pictures both of what her first term would look like and a dire portrait of Trump’s potential return. Harris campaign advisers previewed the speech last week on the condition of anonymity to discuss an event they said was still in the development stage. After he lost the 2020 election, Trump sought to convince his supporters he won, including during a now-infamous speech from the Ellipse. He told his supporters during the speech to march to the Capitol so they could pressure lawmakers to overturn the election while they met for a joint session of Congress to formally certifyPresident Joe Biden’s victory. In the hours afterward, a riot unfolded at the Capitol; Trumphas been indicted for his rolein working to overturn the election results in the run-up to the insurrection attempt. In the closing days of this year’s presidential election, the vice president and her team have sought to underscore the stakes of the election, repeatedly warning of a potential second Trump term and seizing on the former president’s controversial policies and comments to make their argument. Seven states will prove key to electing the next president of the United States:Arizona,Wisconsin,North Carolina,Georgia,Michigan,NevadaandPennsylvania. So what is a swing st﻿ate, and why is their vote so important? There are 538 Electoral College votes split among the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Each state gets at least three votes, depending on the size of their congressional delegation. Congressional seats are assigned to each state based on their population. So, the smallest states get three electoral college votes (they have two senators and one member of Congress). Washington, DC, also gets three. The most populous states get a lot more: California gets 54 electoral votes (it has two senators and 52 congressional districts), Texas has 40, Florida has 30, New York has 28 and so on. In almost all states, the winning candidate takes all electoral votes. Whichever candidate gets 270 or more electoral votes becomes president. Some states are historically blue (where Democrats dominate) or red (where Republicans dominate). The swing states are those where voters don’t tend to consistently vote for the same party, but swing states can change from election to election. The bigger swing states, such as Pennsylvania, have more congressional seats, and are therefore extra important for a candidate’s road to 270. And if a candidate wins three or more swing states, they’re more likely to win the election. That’s why the seven swing states could determine who becomes president. After the 2020 election, chaos erupted at a Detroit counting center as Joe Biden overtook Donald Trump. This year, election officials have given CNN exclusive access to see how they’re trying to avoid the mayhem and get faster results. With thepresidential contestexpected to be the most litigated in US history, both campaigns have spent years laying the groundwork for a post-election courtroom battle by recruiting lawyers in every state, wargaming possible scenarios and drafting potential pleadings. Courts across the country have been flooded with lawsuits far earlier than in the 2020 election, mostly from Republican-aligned groups challenging everything from ballot rules to voter qualifications. And the legal challenges could continue for weeks or months to come. In anticipation, both campaigns have assembled teams of lawyers in battleground states and beyond. Donald Trump’s team:Veteran election lawyer Gineen Bresso is heading up the GOP’s so-called election integrity efforts, while David Warrington is serving as the campaign’s general counsel. Warrington is a Washington, DC-based lawyer who represented the former president during the House select committee’s investigation into the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack. After courts tossed all but one GOP lawsuit after the 2020 election, and several lawyers lost their licenses or faced criminal charges over efforts to undermine that election, sources close to the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee say they have been focused on recruiting legal talent this time around. Kamala Harris’ team:Former White House counsel Dana Remus, who led the Joe Biden legal team in the last election, will again lead the legal fight for Harris. Sources familiar with the Democratic strategy say they have recruited hundreds of lawyers across key states with the expertise needed to fight a variety of challenges they could face. Read the full story. If reelected, Donald Trump has made clear that he plansto exact revengeon those he perceives as a threat. His “enemies” list seems to be constantly growing as the election nears, and includes Democratic politicians, the media, lawyers and political donors who he believes were“involved in unscrupulous behavior.” Any CEO with a memory of Trump’s first term knows that it’s wise to take those threats seriously, as the president didn’t hesitate to sound off and, witha single social media post, sink a company’sstockor spark aboycott. Whiledozensof American business leaders have used their money and powerto resist that kind of bullyingand endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, others are choosing to bend the knee. Or to keep just quiet enough to avoid becoming a target. Editorial endorsement controversy:Post owner Jeff Bezos didn’t endorse Trump explicitly. Instead, heblocked the paper’s editorial pagefrom endorsing any candidate for the first time in decades — a not-at-all subtle nod to the Republican nominee, and one that legendary former Post editor Marty Baron called an act of cowardice. Baron, who retired from the Post in 2021, on Saturday told CNN’s Michael Smerconish that Trump has threatened Bezos “continually,” but that Bezos had previously resisted that pressure. “I was very grateful … for his willingness to stand up to the pressure from Donald Trump in 2015 … until now. But the fact is that Bezos has other commercial interests,” including a large stake in Amazon and a private space company, Blue Origin. And Blue Origin, of course, competes directly with SpaceX, the rocket maker owned by outspoken Trump supporter Elon Musk, for government contracts.

Record-high prices at the pumpdealt a financial scare to consumers and created a political wound the Biden-Harris administration has struggled to mend ever since. But now the situation has reversed. Gas prices, an in-your-face metric that many consumers view as a real-time barometer for the cost of living, are falling fast, just as millions of Americans head to the polls. Gas is much cheaper in battleground states like Nevada and Arizona than a year ago. And for the first time since 2021, the national average has a real shot at plunging below $3 a gallon in the coming days. It’s a crucial trend that undercuts one of the biggest arguments Republicans have used to hammer Democrats over the cost of living. Of course, the cost of living remains a major issue for millions of Americans. And former President Donald Trump continues to poll better than Vice President Kamala Harris onwho voters trust more to handle the economy. Read the full analysis here. Retired federal appeals court Judge J. Michael Luttig, a prominent conservative legal scholar, is urging Republicans to put the country before their party this Election Day and reject Donald Trump, who, he says, has “ever so betrayed America.” Luttig, who was put on the bench by President George H.W. Bush,endorsed Vice President Kamala Harrisin August. The election marks the first time the veteran of two Republican administrations will for a Democrat. Voters, the former judge says, must decide on November 5 “whether Donald Trump is fit to be President of the United States again,” adding: “He is not.” Invoking Trump’srecent commentson using military force on Election Day to handle the “enemy from within,” he says the former president “betrayed us” when he before sat in the Oval Office. “There could be no higher duty of American citizenship than to decisively repudiate a man who betrayed the nation when he was previously entrusted with the highest office in the land and now threatens the persecution of American citizens who have crossed him. In the almost 250 years since the founding of the nation, no president before Donald Trump has ever so betrayed America,” Luttig writes. Luttig played anow famous rolein persuading then-Vice President Mike Pence to defy Trump to certify the 2020 presidential election and has since emerged as a preeminent constitutional critic of Trump, who he has described as an existential threat to American democracy. Steve Bannon was released from federal prison Tuesday, according to a source, emerging just a week before Election Day to retake the helm of his weakened right-wing media platform. Bannon, a right-wing podcast host and the chief executive of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, has remained a strident supporter of the former president. Even as he reported to federal prison in Connecticut in July, Bannon insisted he would influence the presidential race from behind bars and that his “War Room” podcast would continue to energize the Trump base. While in prison, Bannon digitally kept in touch with a small group of loyalists, including some of those who served as guest host for the podcast, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Bannon would in part discuss news of the day and politics including topics he thought about for the show. Bannon was met early Tuesday morning by his daughter Maureen. He is expected to host his radio program later on Tuesday. He was convicted in 2022 on two counts of contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. He is continuing to appeal his conviction. While in prison, Bannon’s MAGA megaphone has suffered in his absence. “War Room,” which frequently appeared in Apple’s Top Podcasts before Bannon reported to prison, fell off the charts by early July, according to data from Podchaser. By another measure, the podcast was once near the top of the Apple political podcast charts and has since fallen out of the top 25, per Podchaser data. While Bannon’s show is mainly seen as an energized for the Trump base, data from Edison Research’s podcast metrics found that nearly half of Bannon’s audience was made up of Republicans but about a third of listeners were independents.

Former PresidentDonald Trumpand Vice PresidentKamala Harrishave laid out a broad array of ideas aimed at making life more affordable and strengthening the economy, which rank at the top of voters’ concerns. Nearly all of the measures on their differing wish lists, which lack detail, would require congressional approval. That could be tough to achieve in the current partisan climate on Capitol Hill. Here are some of them: Expiring tax cuts:Some parts of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, one of Trump’s signature achievements during his time in the White House, are scheduled to lapse at the end of 2025. Cut prices: Read a full comparison of the candidate’s proposals. A wide-ranging campaign by Republican officials and conservative groups is highlighting voting by noncitizens — a problem that voting experts say is virtually nonexistent. The debate is raging from Ohio to Texas, and the US Supreme Court could rule as soon as Tuesday on alegal battle in Virginiaover an eleventh-hour effort by Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin to remove nearly 1,600 suspected noncitizens from the rolls ahead of next week’s election. Some context:Republican officials around the country claim they have uncovered thousands of noncitizens on their rolls and are filing new lawsuits alleging the Biden administration is withholding key information that allows them to verify that only US citizens are casting ballots. But those claims have not always stood up to scrutiny, and eligible voters — including naturalized citizens — have often been found among those identified by Republicans as suspected noncitizens. Two thousand people had their registrations reactivated by Alabama officials from an initial August purge list of 3,200 suspected noncitizens after further investigation confirmed their citizenship, and that was before acourt order reversing the purge program. Voting rights activists who sued over Virginia’s purge program said that within a day of getting their hands on the list of removed voters, they were able to confirm that 18 of them were in fact citizens. Courts in those cases, which were brought by the Biden administration and outside groups, blocked those programs because of a federal law that prohibits “systematic” purges too close to an election. That hasn’t stopped former PresidentDonald Trumpand his allies from accusing a “weaponized” Justice Department of trying to let noncitizens vote. Read the full story. Vice PresidentKamala Harrisand former PresidentDonald Trumpare trying to reach as many voters are possible as they make their final pitch to Americans, one week out fromElection Day.

Former first ladyMichelle Obamawill headline a rally aimed at boosting voter turnout in Atlanta, Georgia. The event is being coordinated through “When We All Vote,” a non-partisan organization Obama started in 2018 to work on voter engagement, and is geared towards mobilizing first-time voters, including college and high school students. CNN’s Christian Sierra, Christina Asencio and Brian Rokus contributed reporting to this post. Since former President Donald Trump has led the Republican Party, many Republicans strongly prefer to vote on Election Day, while Democrats nationwide have shown a preference to cast their ballots in advance. CNN’s most recent national pollfound that Vice President Kamala Harris had a large lead among voters who said they had already cast their ballots, despite a tied race among likely voters overall. But the Trump campaign has made more of an effort this year toencourage Republicansto vote early and by mail, a major shift from messaging against preelection voting in 2020. Republicans make up 35% of the early vote in the 27 states where research company Catalist has comparable data, up from 28% at the same point in 2020. Democrats, who made up 45% of the early vote at this point in 2020, account for 39% of preelection ballots cast now. Read more about early voters. With one week until Election Day,more than 43 million ballots have been castacross 47 states and the District of Columbia. That’s according to data gathered by CNN, Edison Research and Catalist,a company that provides data, analytics and other services to Democrats, academics and nonprofit advocacy groups, including insights into who is voting before November. So far,preelection voting across the countryis down significantly from this point four years ago, when a record number of voters turned out before Election Day amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The preelection total is more than a quarter of the roughly 158 million votes cast for president in 2020. What we know about early voters:Across the states where Catalist has comparable data, early voters so far are older, slightly more likely to be White and more likely to be Republican than they were at this point four years ago. These trends also generally hold, where data is available, in the seven states that are likely to decide the election. Early voting trends cannot predict the outcome of an election, but they canprovide clues about who is voting. Across 39 states where Catalist has data for both years, voters ages 65 and older make up 46% of all returned ballots, up 10 percentage points from this point in 2020. Voters ages 30-39 have cast 9% of early ballots, down from 12% in 2020. About 74% of voters in those states are White, up slightly from 73% at this point four years ago, while Black, Latino and Asian voters make up slightly smaller shares of the early voting electorate.

Vice President Kamala Harrisis the Democratic candidate for president. The daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica, Harris grew up in Oakland and spent much of her political career in California’s Bay Area. She was first elected as the San Francisco district attorney in 2004, before later serving as the attorney general of California. After that, Harris was elected to the Senate before being picked to be President Joe Biden’s running mate in the 2020 election. She announced her own candidacy for the Democratic nomination for president after Biden withdrew from the ticket and endorsed her on July 21. Harris is the first Black woman and first Asian American to lead the ticket of a major political party. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walzis Harris’ running mate. Before being elected to Congress to represent the state’s 1st Congressional District in 2007, Walz was a high school geography teacher and an assistant football coach. He also served in the Army National Guard. Walz has been serving as Minnesota governor since 2019. Former President Donald Trumpis the Republican candidate for president, aiming to become only the second commander in chief to win two nonconsecutive terms. Trump, who was born in New York, graduated from the University of Pennsylvania with a bachelor’s degree in economics. Before launching his successful 2016 presidential bid, Trump was a real estate developer, businessman and a reality television star as host of “The Apprentice.” Ohio Sen. JD Vanceis Trump’s running mate. Born in Middletown, Ohio, Vance wrote a memoir, “Hillbilly Elegy,” about his upbringing and white, working-class Americans. He also attended Yale Law School, worked as a venture capitalist and served in the US Marine Corps. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2023, outlasting a stronger-than-expected challenge fromDemocrat Tim Ryanand keeping the seat under GOP control.

Both Kamala Harris and Donald Trump have focused on a slate of issues during their campaigns ahead of the US presidential election. In aSeptember CNN poll, about four in 10 likely voters (41%) called the economy the most important issue for them as they choose a candidate for president, with protecting democracy second at 21%, immigration at 12% and abortion at 11%. Here’s what you need to know about the issues: Read aboutHarris’andTrump’scampaign promises on key issues. As advisers to Vice President Kamala Harriswere mulling where to stagethe final major address of her campaign, they had a few boxes to check. The venue, they believed, must convey a degree of gravity about the choice before voters. But equally important, in their view, was its ability to evokethe promise of the office she seeks. In the Ellipse — the patch of park whereDonald Trumprallied his supporters on January 6, 2021, within view of the White House — they believe they found that equilibrium. For Harris, striking a balance between dire warnings about a rival she calls a fascist and forward-looking optimism about the president she would be has become a defining challenge of the campaign’s closing stretch. Despite the sober overtones of the setting, Harris’ advisers say the speech will be hopeful and optimistic, and not focused exclusively on the events that unfolded at the site nearly four years ago. If there is a takeaway from that day she wants to drive home, it is that her own victory would turn the page on Trump’s divisiveness, according to advisers. Read the full story. The archbishop of Puerto Rico’s capital city has condemned ajoke made by a speakerat a Donald Trump rally on Sunday, saying that he was “dismayed and appalled” by the comments. Comedian and podcast host Tony Hinchcliffe opened the rally in New York City, saying: “I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.” The comments have drawn fierce backlash, including from Trump allies, even as the former president’s campaign has tried to distance itself from Hinchcliffe’s joke. San Juan Archbishop Roberto O. Gonzalez Nieves responded with an online statement, saying: “Puerto Rico is not a floating island of garbage” and that it was “a beautiful country inhabited by beautiful and noble people.” Puerto Rico is a US territory﻿. Hinchcliffe has responded to the criticism, writing on X: “These people have no sense of humor.” Trump’s running mate JD Vance also dismissed the backlash. “A comedian told a joke, and I don’t think that’s news worth making,” Vance said. The archbishop countered such defenses: “I enjoy a good joke. However, humor has its limits.” Jokes should not “insult or denigrate” people, and Hinchcliffe’s comment had provoked “hatred,” he added, calling on Trump to “disavow these comments” and personally apologize. The presidential campaign is in its final sprint as Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump visit battleground states. Harris is leaning into her messaging on abortion rights andcontrasting her character with Trump’s, while he hammers Democrats on immigration and the economy. Millions of people have already cast their ballots in the deadlocked race. Thelatest CNN pollfinds the candidates neck-and-neck. Here’s a recap of what happened on Monday: Former President Barack Obama at a rally in Philadelphia Monday criticized the racist and vulgar language used during a Donald Trump rally in New York the night before as he made his case for Vice President Kamala Harris. “So the man [Trump] holds this big rally in Madison Square Garden, and the warm-up speakers were saying the most — were trotting out and peddling the most racist, sexist, bigoted stereotypes. One guy called Puerto Rico, quote, ‘an island of garbage,’” Obama said. Trump’s rally Sunday night featured opening remarks from comedian and podcast host Tony Hinchcliffe,who assailed Puerto Rico, saying, “I don’t know if you know this but there’s literally a floating island of garbage in the middle of the ocean right now. I think it’s called Puerto Rico.” “Now, these are fellow citizens he’s talking about here in Philadelphia, they are your neighbors, they are your friends, they are your coworkers, their kids go to school with your kids. These are Americans,” Obama said. About 500,000 Puerto Ricans live in battleground Pennsylvania, where Obama held Monday night’s rally. “We have to reject the kind of politics of divisions and hatred that we saw represented,” Obama said. “America is ready to turn the page.” Trump’s campaigndistanced itselffrom the comedian’s comments Sunday night along with several Republican lawmakers, but not before they were seized upon by the Harris campaign and likes ofPuerto Rican superstar Bad Bunny, who signaled his support for the vice president’s candidacy.",Global
18,"The 2024 election, explained","Who, what, when and where? It can be valuable to take a step back from the day-to-day news and look with a wider lens at theelectionplaying out. Here are answers to some more general questions that can get lost at the end of the campaign. US law requires a presidential election every four years. These general elections, since 1845, are required to occur on the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. This year, that date is November 5. States oversee their own elections, which means polling times vary from state to state. The first polls close on Election Day at 6 p.m. ET in some counties in Indiana and Kentucky, and the last polls close at 1 a.m. ET Wednesday, November 6, in Alaska. Waves of state polls close every hour in between. But many millions of Americans willvote early in person or by mail. Get information about your state inCNN’s Voter Handbook. Each state conducts their election a little bit differently. Some, like in Washington state, Oregon and Utah, are done almost entirely by mail, a process that stretches for weeks. Every state has some form of early voting available, which opens the process to people who can’t get to the polls on Election Day and ensures as many people cast ballots as possible. The Democrat is Vice President Kamala Harris, who is on the ballot with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her vice presidential running mate. The Republican is former President Donald Trump, who is running this year with Sen. JD Vance of Ohio. There are other candidates, and the options vary by state. The Libertarian Party’s Chase Oliver is on most ballots, and the Green Party’s Jill Stein is an option in most states as well. The former Democrat Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is also on the ballot in many states. He had been running as an independent but has since endorsed Trump. That said, the vast majority of Americans will vote for either Harris or Trump. Read more about the presidential candidates. The two major parties, Republicans and Democrats, each held primary elections across the country earlier in the year. Despite the fact that many Republicans repudiated Trump after his supporters stormed the Capitol building following his loss in the 2020 election, the former president easily emerged from a crowded field of primary candidates to be the GOP nominee again this year. It’s the third straight election where Trump is the Republican nominee. For Democrats, President Joe Biden dominated the primaries and faced only token opposition. But after the primary season, concerns about Biden’s age – he’s 81 – accelerated. After CNN hosteda debate in June in which Biden fared poorlyagainst Trump, the president bowed to pressure and dropped out of the race before Democrats held their nominating convention. Biden’s endorsement of Harris, his vice president, helped make her the consensus nominee despite the fact that she did not take part in primaries. No Democrats rose to challenge her at the convention in August. It could take a while. CNN did not project a winner in 2020 until four days after Election Day. Multiple states were decided by incredibly close margins that year. In 2016, Hillary Clinton conceded the day after Election Day even though counting was still happening in multiple states. She acknowledged she would not win. Trump is unlikely ever to acknowledge defeat. If there are close margins in key states, it could take days to determine a winner. The good news is that many states have made changes since 2020 to make it easier for election officials to get a head start on processing mail-in ballots, which take longer to count. In 2000, one of the closest elections in US history, the winner was not apparent until 36 days after the election when the USSupreme Court ended recounts in Florida. Things were complicated that year by flawed paper ballots in some Florida counties, something that should not be a problem this year. It could also end up not being that close of an election at all, and networks like CNN could project a winner on election night. We shall see. One overriding issue is the cost of living.Prices spiked after the Covid-19 pandemic, andTrump has capitalized on a nostalgiapeople have for a time when the cost of groceries was lower. His plan to imposeacross-the-board tariffson foreign goods might spike prices further, according to economists, but he has an advantage over Harris on the economy, according to polling. Trump voters are also motivated by immigration.He woulddeport millions of migrantswho crossed the border illegally, and he would all but shut down the US border. Read more about the promises Trump has made on the campaign trail. For Harris voters, the issue of abortion is key.After the Supreme Court, with a third of justices appointed by Trump, overturned Roe v. Wade, Harris has framed reproductive rights as matter of personal freedom and has pledged to protect those rights. There are ballot initiatives in key states to enshrine abortion rights. The issue is helping drive a gender gap in the vote, according to polling. Read more about Harris’ campaign promises. There is also the key issue of democracy.Trump was accused by the Justice Department of election interference after he tried to overturn the 2020 election results. That’s a nonstarter for many Democrats. Republicans, meanwhile, have largely grown to accept Trump’s role in the effort to keep Biden from the White House after he won in 2020. And many of them, after years of Trump questioning the system, now doubt the 2020 results themselves. Trump was convicted on felony charges in New York related to hush money payments before the 2016 election. His sentencing is set for late November, meaning it will be after Election Day. However, his felony convictions, or even the possibility of jail time, don’t make Trump ineligible to serve as president. More than 150 million people are likely to cast ballots for the office of president on or before Election Day. But it’s 538 electors who will choose the president ina process that snakes through December and January. When voters cast ballots, they are actually selecting a slate of electors tied to the candidate who wins the popular vote in each state. The electors will then cast votes for president and vice president in each state’s capitol on December 17. That meeting is also known as theElectoral College, and it’s required in the Constitution. Those electoral votes will be counted in the chamber of the House of Representatives on January 6, 2025, with the new Congress looking on. The new president takes office on January 20, 2025. The number is tied to the size of a state’s congressional delegation, with one electoral vote for each senator and member of Congress. The smallest states – Alaska, Delaware, the two Dakotas, Vermont and Wyoming – each get three. With each additional member of Congress, a state gets one more elector. The most populous states are California (54 electoral votes), Texas (40 electoral votes) and Florida (30 electoral votes). These numbers can change every 10 years because the Constitution requires an official population count, or census, and the number of congressional seats is then reapportioned. The most recent census occurred in 2020, so the number of electoral votes has changed. Voters in Washington, DC, also get three electoral votes thanks to the 23rd Amendment, but they have no voting representation in the House or Senate. Other US citizens who don’t live in a state, like Puerto Ricans, aren’t so lucky when it comes to electoral votes. There are 538 electors. That figure is equal to 100 senators and 435 members of Congress, plus three votes for Washington, DC. A majority of electoral votes is 270. Winning the White House is a mapping exercise for presidential candidates. They must pair the states that are safely in their column with enough battleground states toget to 270. There are thought to be seven states that could conceivably be won by either candidate. As a result, the campaigns have focused their energy in these areas. They can be broken up into two general categories. 3 Midwestern battlegrounds, aka “the blue wall”– These are the manufacturing and union-heavy states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. They used to be more reliably Democratic but have shifted in recent years as their populations have changed and as Trump has appealed to White voters without a college degree. When Trump won the White House in 2016, he won all three. When Biden won in 2020, he won all three. If Harris wins all three this year, she will likely have the electoral votes to be president. But polls suggest close races in all three. Turnout will be key, which for Harris means appealing to suburban women and Black voters. All three states have urban centers. The blue wall states usually vote the same way. The last time they did not all go to the same candidate was in 1988 – notably also a year when California was red and West Virginia was blue. In those eight elections since 1988, the only time the blue wall states went to a Republican was in 2016, when they were won by Trump. 4 Sun Belt battlegrounds– These states with growing populations include Arizona and Nevada in the West and North Carolina and Georgia in the East. Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina used to be more reliably Republican. Trump won North Carolina twice, but the margins were close in 2020. The last Democrat to win there was Barack Obama in 2008. Biden was the first Democrat to win Georgia since Bill Clinton in 1992 and Arizona since Clinton in 1996. 1 vote in Nebraska is a battleground– 48 states award their electoral votes winner-take-all to the victor in their state. Nebraska and Maine do it differently, awarding votes by congressional district. The state of Nebraska is safe Trump territory, but the congressional district around Omaha is a battleground. That one vote could end up being very important in the event of a close race in the Electoral College. Note:It’s the reverse situation in Maine, the only other state that does not award all of its electors to the statewide winner. Trump could pick up a single electoral vote in Maine. The total number of electoral votes, 538, is an even number, which meansa tie is conceivable. It’s happened once before, in 1800, although the rules were a bit different then. If no candidate reaches the 270 votes needed to win the election, the new Congress would pick the president and the Senate would pick the vice president in what’s known as a “contingent election.” Each of the 50 states would get one vote (sorry, Washington, DC). Republicans currently control more House delegations. Even if they lose the overall House majority in November, Republicans would still probably control more than half of the congressional delegations. Delegations in which there’s an even split between Republicans and Democrats (currently there are two) would not be counted. Bottom line: An Electoral College tie would likely result in a Trump presidency. In the Senate, it’s a simpler process. Each senator would get one vote to select the vice president. Democrats have a slim majority at the moment, but they are defending more seats on Election Day and there’s a good chance Republicans will control the Senate come January. Every two years, every seat in the House, all 435 of them, is up for grabs. Most of those seats are relatively safe for either Republicans or Democrats, but there is always the possibility that the majority changes hands. Democrats are favored in 208 races and Republicans are favored in 212, according to preelectionHouse race ratingsfrom Inside Elections with Nathan L. Gonzales. With just 15 races listed as toss-ups, it’s likely that neither party will have a very large majority next year. Changes in the balance of power have actually happened more in recent elections. This year, Republicans are heading into the election with a small majority, and it’s entirely possible that Democrats win their own small majority for the next House even if they lose the White House and control of the Senate. It’s important for either party to control the House. Presidents need control to enact their priorities. The out-of-power party wants control to block the president’s priorities. In an ideal world, the two sides would work together to find consensus on issues like immigration and the tax code. It’s a little bit different in the Senate, where only a third of the seats are up for grabs every two years. Democrats are on defense as they try to defend their slim Senate majority. Of the 34 seats for which there is an election this year, Democrats are defending 20 and Republicans are defending 13. Two of those Democratic seats, in West Virginia and Montana, are likely to be won by Republicans, according to theSenate race ratings. Another one, in Ohio, is rated as a toss-up. Democrats hope they can pick up an unexpected win in either Texas or Florida, but Republicans are on pace to have a slim majority in the Senate next year. Assuming Republicans hold all of the seats they currently hold, they can control the chamber if they flip one Democratic seat and win the White House (the vice president breaks ties in the Senate) or win two seats regardless of the outcome of the presidential race. No matter who has control of the Senate, neither party is expected to have a supermajority. That’s important because senators generally abide by a custom of respecting the filibuster. It usually requires 60 votes to enact major pieces of legislation, although both Republicans and Democrats have found ways around that in recent years. Republicans found a way to enact tax cuts under Trump without 60 votes. Democrats did the same thing with their Inflation Reduction Act, which, among other things, aims to transition the US to a greener economy.",Global

20,Steve Bannon is released from prison in time for the last-week push to Election Day,"Steve Bannon was released from federal prison Tuesday, according to a source with knowledge, emerging just a week before Election Day to retake the helm of his weakened right-wing media platform. Bannon, a right-wing podcast host and the chief executive of Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, has remained a strident supporter of the former president. Even as he reported to federal prison in Connecticut in July, Bannon insisted he would influence the presidential race from behind bars and that his “War Room” podcast would continue to energize the Trump base. Bannon was met early Tuesday morning by his daughter Maureen. He is expected to host his radio program later Tuesday morning. He was convicted in 2022 on two counts of contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol. He is continuing to appeal his conviction. While in prison, Bannon digitally kept in touch with a small group of loyalists, including some who served as guest hosts for the podcast, according to two sources familiar with the matter. Bannon would in part discuss news of the day and politics including topics he thought about for the show. However, Bannon’s MAGA megaphone has suffered in his absence. “War Room,” which frequently appeared in Apple’s Top Podcasts before Bannon reported to prison, fell off the charts by early July, according to data from Podchaser. By another measure, the podcast was once near the top of the Apple political podcast charts and has since fallen out of the top 25, per Podchaser data. There are some signs that it’s ticking up slightly as Bannon prepares to return. “Though we’ve been seeing election denial activists coming on the show still as a central hub, you see that ‘War Room,’ it wasn’t able to sustain itself without Bannon,” said Madeline Peltz, deputy director for rapid response at Media Matters, a progressive nonprofit that does extensive media monitoring. Peltz still predicted Bannon would be a prominent voice for election denialism if it appears Trump is coming up short after Election Day. “I think it’s going to take some time to bring the audience back and to mobilize them,” Peltz said. “I don’t think the one-week period between now and the election is enough time to complete that, but I think really, you’ll see it kick into high gear in the post-election chaos that we’re all sort of anticipating.” While Bannon’s show is mainly seen as an energizer for the Trump base, data from Edison Research’s podcast metrics found that nearly half of Bannon’s audience was made up of Republicans but about a third of listeners were independents. On the “War Room” podcast, a cast of fill-in hosts cheered Bannon’s return. Prominent election conspiracy theorist Mike Lindell offered a deal on his MyPillow products to celebrate Bannon’s release (free pillows, plus shipping and handling, with the relevant discount code.) “It’s less than 24 hours until Stephen K. Bannon is back a free man and preaching the gospel of MAGA here in the ‘War Room,’” Natalie Winters, one of the podcast guest hosts said Monday. Winters then turned her focus to the presidential race, claiming, “It’s not an election, it’s ballot warfare.” It’s the kind of incendiary rhetoric Bannon embraced and promoted as an early voice in the “Stop the Steal” movement in 2020. In May, Bannon claimed on his podcast that “they’re going to do everything to steal this election,” as he reiterated the baseless claim that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. “Bannon is one of the most talented broadcasters among his peers, in terms of taking current events, pulling out a kernel of truth from them, and then spinning an elaborate conspiracy theory on top of it, which then becomes the fuel for the action that’s taken by the grassroots in response to these lies,” Peltz from Media Matters said. “There’s really no one who has quite the same level of talent for that particular misinformation approach.” To mark his release, Bannon’s team said he plans to hold a press conference Tuesday afternoon in New York. This story has been updated with additional developments. CNN’sKristen Holmes,Maria Aguilar Prieto and Maria Sole Campinoti contributed to this report.",Global
21,America’s CEOs don’t have the stomach for Trump’s promised revenge tour,"If reelected, Donald Trump has made clear that he plansto exact revengeon the people and institutions he perceives as a threat. His “enemies” list seems to be constantly growing as the election nears, and includes Democratic politicians, the media, lawyers and political donors who he believes were“involved in unscrupulous behavior.” Any CEO with a memory of Trump’s first term knows that it’s wise to take those threats seriously, as the president didn’t hesitate to sound off and, witha single tweet, sink a company’sstockor spark aboycott. While dozens of American business leaders — yourReeds Hoffman, your Marks Cuban, etc. — have used their money and powerto resist that kind of bullyingand endorse Vice President Kamala Harris, others are choosing to bend the knee. Or to keep just quiet enough to avoid being becoming a target. Jeff Bezos, owner of The Washington Post, didn’t endorse Trump explicitly. Instead, heblocked the paper’s editorial pagefrom endorsing any candidate for the first time in decades — a not-at-all subtle nod to the Republican nominee, and one that legendary former Post editor Marty Baron called an act of cowardice. That move came shortly after the billionaire owner of the Los Angeles Times, Patrick Soon-Shiong,vetoed his editorial board’sendorsement of Harris. Baron, who retired from the Post in 2021, on Saturday told CNN’s Michael Smerconish that Trump has threatened Bezos “continually,” but that Bezos had previously resisted that pressure. “I was very grateful … for his willingness to stand up to the pressure from Donald Trump in 2015 … until now. But the fact is that Bezos has other commercial interests,” including a large stake in Amazon and a private space company, Blue Origin. And Blue Origin, of course, competes directly with SpaceX, the rocket maker owned by outspoken Trump supporter Elon Musk, for government contracts. “Trump rewards his friends and he punishes his perceived political enemies, and I think there’s no other explanation for what’s happening right now,” Baron said. To be clear: What Bezos and Soon-Shiong did here, under a guise of neutrality, is take a very loud position. No Washington Post or LA Times editorial, with all due respect to those institutions, was ever going to meaningfully sway the electorate. But pulling them creates news, and it’s news for an audience of one. (And for Bezos, at least, it may also turn out to be a shockingly bad business decision. AsNPR’s David Folkenflik reportedMonday, some 200,000 people had canceled their digital subscriptions to the paper — about 8% of its subscriber base — over the decision.) Other rich executives are doing diplomacy behind the scenes, as my colleaguesSteve Contorno and Alayna Treene reported: Executives have plenty to worry about under a Trump 2.0 White House, particularly when it comes to trade policies that would force American companies to pay exorbitant markups to the US government for supplies imported from overseas. On top of that, Trump has promised to deport millions of undocumented immigrants, potentially creating a labor shortage, and to put himself in a position to influence interest-rate policy. That’s why88 business leaderslast month endorsed Harris. But in a race this close, many executives are hedging their bets. Sticking their necks out to express their concerns doesn’t really benefit anyone if Trump wins and decides to do, like, all the things he has repeatedly promised to do. On the other hand, a little back-channeling and olive-branch-extending could give business leaders and their companies some goodwill in an administration helmed by a notoriously impulsive, vengeful leader. In a business world that craves certainty and economic stability, executives may be telling themselves that their silence is purely a business decision. But staying quiet is a choice, and it’s not a neutral one when you’re a billionaire with real power.",Global
22,"American Battleground: Christianity and chokeholds, the powerful forces propelling Trump","It’s a warm Saturday afternoon, there’s a threat of rain, and the neighbors are being noisy. A hundred protesters are shouting in front of the White House, telling the man who lives there they admire him, they appreciate what he’s done, and now he needs to get out. “Hey hey, ho ho, thank you, Joe, it’s time to go!” The success of former President Donald Trump’s campaign is becoming a catastrophe for sitting President Joe Biden. The pressure on him to step out of the race has been growing inversely to his fading performance since the Fourth of July. Every few days another incremental creep in the polls pushes him toward that undetermined edge at which his chances of winning reelection will go from long to lost. Trump’s coalition is drawing tighter by the day, and White evangelical Christians are a key component. If any group in Trump land embodies his ethos of feeling besieged, it is this one. In the early 1970s, 90% of Americans identified as Christian. By 2020 it was 64%. Andthe Pew Research Center notes, “If recent trends in religious switching continue, Christians could make up less than half of the U.S. population within a few decades.” So when Trump delivered their long-awaited destruction of Roe v. Wade, they celebrated. And when he promises to bring them back to political power, they listen. “We have to bring back our religion,” he told the National Religious Broadcasters group earlier this year. “We have to bring back Christianity in this country.” A shrewd breakdown by Shadi Hamid inThe Washington Postnotes after Trump nodded to Christian nationalism in 2016 and evangelicals helped him win, membership in evangelical churches grew – fueled by Trump supporters looking for a home. “They became evangelicals because of what it meant politically,” he wrote. “Among White Trump supporters who were not evangelicals in 2016, 16 percent began to identify as evangelical by 2020, suggesting again that politics rather than religion was the driving factor.” For Biden, the committed Catholic, it would seem a particularly bitter pill, especially now as his team and journalists following him are tracking his fortunes by the day – sometimes by the hour – through an agony of indecision. “There were so many ups and downs,” CNN’s MJ Lee says. “And I remember thinking to myself, ‘Am I going to sound like I’m over the top if I go on the air saying Democrats are panicked?’” Biden does not admit any weakness publicly, but his team is sandbagging against a rising river of that panic, much of it from powerful Democrats questioning whether he is still the right person to take on Trump. Trying to recover from the disastrous debate, Biden sits down with ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and mentions he had a cold. “I was sick,” Biden says. “I was feeling terrible.” With NBC’s Lester Holt, Biden acknowledges he had a “bad, bad night,” but bridles at the notion of stepping aside. “Fourteen million people voted for me to be the nominee in the Democratic Party, OK? I listen to them.” Allies, including House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, take to the media circuit. “Joe Biden has confronted and had to come back from tragedy, trials, from tribulations throughout his entire life,” the New York Democrat says, “so the moment that we’re in right now is a comeback moment.” Sen. Chris Coons, from Biden’s home state of Delaware, is unequivocal on ABC’s “This Week”: “The only Democrat who has ever beaten Donald Trump is Joe Biden. He is our candidate for November.” It is Biden’s most compelling argument. In the grinding, Covid-haunted 2020 race, he was the wise, old warrior who drew suburban voters, women and young people to his side. His long-standing ties to the working class and organized labor helped nudge him across the finish line to a narrow but clear victory. But now, the tightening vise squeezes Biden into the highly unusual position of sending a letter to congressional Democrats. “I want you to know that despite all the speculation in the press and elsewhere,” he writes, “I am firmly committed to staying in this race, to running this race to the end, and to beating Donald Trump.” He also keeps hammering Trump’s vulnerabilities – the former president’s criminal record, the myriad cases still hovering, the January 6, 2021, riot, the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade – hoping to crack the mogul’s gathering edge in the polls. One potential weakness in particular draws Biden’s attention. “Project 2025 is the biggest attack on our system of government and our personal freedom that has ever been proposed,” the president bellows during a fired-up rally in Detroit. “It is a project that was built for Trump!” Launched by the Heritage Foundation, a staunchly conservative DC think tank, Project 2025 is a 900-page plan for action to be set into motion the moment Trump wins reelection. With ideas from hundreds of conservative leaders, it calls for quickly and vastly expanding presidential powers, replacing tens of thousands of government workers with right-wing ideologues, weaponizing the Justice Department to pursue political foes, establishing a nationwide abortion ban, rolling back LGBTQ rights, trashing many environmental regulations, outlawing pornography and much more. For some conservatives, it is a definitive strategy for draining the swamp. For some Democrats, it is a blueprint for totalitarianism. The explosive document bubbles quietly under the surface of other campaign news for a while, but Biden drags it into the light and, at least on this issue, Trump is on the run. “I know nothing about Project 2025. I have no idea who is behind it,” the former president says in his ceaseless string of social media posts. “Some of the things they are saying are absolutely ridiculous and abysmal.” The problem he faces is in the document’s pedigree. According to a CNN review, at least 140 people who formerly worked in the Trump administration helped craft the plan, including many whom Trump still talks to on a regular basis: Ben Carson, Ken Cuccinelli, Mark Meadows, Stephen Miller, Peter Navarro. As much as Trump insists Project 2025 is foreign to him, the ties look suspicious. What’s more, CNN’s Phil Mattingly says, the document is linked behind the scenes to an army of loyalists lined up by conservative coordinators to step into those government jobs immediately with Project 2025 as their battle plan. “What they’ve been doing in concert with the policy operation,” Mattingly says, “is they’ve been collecting thousands of names, resumes, mapping out exactly where those people would go. You get a bunch of true believers in there, you’re going to actually implement the stuff.” Biden is also benefiting from other moves Trump cannot easily disown. Just two days after the assassination attempt against the former president in Pennsylvania, on the sleepy first day of the Republican National Convention in battleground Wisconsin, Trump announces his pick for a running mate. “After lengthy deliberation and thought, and considering the tremendous talents of many others,” Trump writes on Truth Social, “I have decided that the person best suited to assume the position of Vice President of the United States is Senator J.D. Vance of the Great State of Ohio.” The words are surprisingly effusive considering Vance once called Trump a “moral disaster,” repeatedly suggested he believed Trump hadcommitted sexual assaultand was wondered whether he was “America’s Hitler.” But Vance had backtracked as he prepared to run for Senate, telling Fox News in 2021, “I did say those critical things and I regret them, and I regret being wrong about the guy.” Now, with the winds blowing in his favor, Trump has found in the contrite politician a running mate and an eventual heir to the MAGA throne. But if Republicans are ready to forgive and forget Vance’s former positions, Democrats are not. “Vance will do what Mike Pence wouldn’t on January 6,” Biden campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon crows, referring to Trump’s former vice president who stood firm against demands he upend the 2020 election process. A fundraising appeal from the Biden campaign says, “How does a guy who used to say that Donald Trump and his policies were ‘reprehensible,’ become Donald Trump’s running mate? Through years of being a rubber-stamp for Donald Trump’s extreme, MAGA agenda. You might even say he’s the poster child for Project 2025.” Vance is attacked over his flipflops, his stand against abortion rights, his attitude toward women — and then the cat lady thing happens. Three years earlier, as he was vying for the GOP Senate nomination in Ohio, the future VP candidate served up a nugget for the Fox News audience. He griped that the country was being run by “a bunch of childless cat ladies who are miserable at their own lives and the choices that they’ve made and so they want to make the rest of the country miserable, too.” Then he added, “You look at Kamala Harris, Pete Buttigieg, AOC — the entire future of the Democrats is controlled by people without children. And how does it make any sense that we’ve turned our country over to people who don’t really have a direct stake in it?” When the clip resurfaces, the outcry is instantaneous. Women voters, whom the Trump campaign desperately needs, start posting cat memes sharply critical of Vance’s views. Late-night comedians have a field day. Trump says his running mate is “not against anything. He loves family, it’s very important to him.” Vance tries to spin the old clip — and others in which he refers to “childless sociopaths” — as sarcasm. The whole mess goes viral anyway, and Trump’s VP pick starts looking like a punchline. Still, CNN’s Alayna Treene says, with so much good news for Trump, the internal concern over his running mate is muted. “The reporting in the stories about them second-guessing whether they were going to pick somebody else and try to replace Vance was not true,” she says, “(but) they definitely thought it was a bad rollout.” Public scrutiny of Vance, however, does not take pressure off Biden, and there is little time for laughter at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. Biden’s attempts to quiet the mutiny in his party are crumbling. Calls for him to step out of the race are ricocheting from pundits to major Democratic donors including movie star George Clooney, who had just headlined an event for Biden. And the stumbles keep coming. At the NATO summit Biden calls Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky “President Putin.” Zelensky laughs it off, but the seriousness of such errors is intensifying. More than two dozen House Democrats are now asking Biden to end his reelection bid. Former President Barack Obama and House Speaker Emeritus Nancy Pelosi are not telling Biden to abandon his run, but they are voicing concerns. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer shares his firsthand account of the unrest among his caucus when he visits Biden at his beach house in Delaware where the president is recovering from what is reported to be a case of Covid. At the center of the issue is math. It is an axiom of presidential elections that when a Democrat and a Republican are tied in national polls, the Democrat is often losing. Democratic voters are more heavily clustered in urban areas where they can help their party win a state by huge margins. Republicans, who are more spread out, may win their states by smaller raw numbers, but they collect all the electoral votes in those states anyway. The polling models are adjusted after each election to account for imperfections, so perhaps this time will see the electoral field releveled. But recent history tells a simple story: Biden tallied a 4-percentage point edge in the popular vote against Trump in 2020 and won. Hillary Clinton secured a popular lead of roughly 2 percentage points in 2016 and lost. The polls suggest Biden is trailing her numbers now. Make no mistake, Biden is a hero for many Democrats; the guy who emerged from what they saw as the chaos of Trump’s first term, pushed the MAGA leader out of the Oval Office, and took the nation back toward something that felt more normal. And Biden, who still traces so much of the turn in his fortunes to that cursed debate, is not surrendering. Not yet. “What I call Biden’s ‘stubborn Irish’ kicked in,” CNN’s John King says, parroting the president’s defense. “‘It was just one night. It wasn’t as bad as you think. We can recover.’” Yet each time Biden has a strong speech, a quick joke or a firm stride, he invariably sputters in his next appearance with misstatements, forgotten names and the shuffling gait of advanced age. Some in the party say the lack of consensus on whether Biden should stay or go is turning into a “doom loop” weakening his bid through sheer uncertainty. “People see and feel the walls closing in,” a senior Democratic player says. And Trump is steaming toward the biggest night of his convention looking confident, strong and perhaps unbeatable. “Let Trump-a-mania run wild! Let Trump-a-mania rule again!” Wrestler Hulk Hogan is hyping the crowd at the Republican National Convention. Tearing off a black T-shirt emblazoned with an American flag to reveal a red Trump-Vance shirt beneath, he invokes an oddly apt phrase for fans and foes alike to describe the former president’s approach to government. “Let Trump-a-mania make America great again!” For days, the RNC has been pure celebration. Speaker after speaker has competed to raise the highest praise for Trump and the worst damnation of Democrats. The official party platform reads less like the dry policy documents of old, and more like a Trump speech packed with grandiose claims and questionable facts. Few in the room betray the slightest doubt that in the final rounds of the election, Trump will fling Biden from the ring like a rag doll. For Trump, his dominance over Biden in the past three weeks has clearly sweetened everything about this convocation. Teamsters President Sean O’Brien is head of a labor union that had endorsed Hillary Clinton and Biden in past years, but mindful of the rising tide of Trump supporters in his organization, he takes the stage to salute the former president as “one tough SOB.” Trump’s former primary challengers have been bowing before him and disavowing their own criticism from just months before: South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, tech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, and the last holdout, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley. She infuriated the Trump faithful earlier in the year by refusing to quit the race and calling him “toxic.” At the convention, her defiance turns to abject surrender as she says, “Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period.” Beaming from his seat in Milwaukee’s Fiserv Forum, Trump takes in the spectacle of the Grand Old Party entirely within his thrall. With a large white bandage over the ear injured in the assassination attempt, he looks happy in the moment and deeply pleased that Hogan is sharing it with him. The perennial wrestling all-star was a key figure when Trump first fell in love with the melodrama and money tied to professional wrestling. Trump brought it all to Atlantic City in the late 1980s, launching a decadeslong relationship with the spectacles of sweat and spandex. Sometimes he took part: strutting around arenas as crowds cheered and booed, luxuriating in the “extra” of it all. He landed a spot in the celebrity wing of the World Wrestling Entertainment Hall of Fame, alongside Mr. T, Ozzy Osbourne and the late comedian, Andy Kaufman. Trump’s affection for the exhibitions is understandable. Pro wrestling is athletic, but not really a sport. It has winners and losers, but they are predetermined. Champions are anointed mainly based on fictional storylines, not the hard facts of their prowess. As Chauncey DeVegawrote for Salonin 2015, Trump’s first presidential bid was deeply rooted in the “outsize characters and operatic storylines” of pro wrestling. Good versus evil. Ultimate victory or ultimate defeat. Champions and chumps. As the crowd cheers Trump to the podium for his centerpiece speech on the RNC’s final night, it is easy to see how those black-and-white paradigms resonate against the gray uncertainty of the times. In the eight years since he won the White House, Trump has forced the Republican Party to embrace his view that anything except complete loyalty is betrayal; anything short of absolute domination is failure; and God-fearing Americans will lose everything they love about their county if he is not putting his feet up on the Resolute Desk again next January. “Four months from now, we will have an incredible victory and we will begin the four greatest years in the history of our country,” he says, launching into an address that defeated candidates seldom get to make. But tonight, he is no loser. In this hall, the adoring crowd believes he won the last election. They believe they were cheated. They know Biden is on the ropes. Some of those evangelical Christians admit his multiple marriages, alleged sexual escapades, profane language, brutish behavior, lies and crimes are troubling. But they are also spellbound by how he weathers the scandals, financial setbacks and criminal prosecutions.Persecutions, he has said, invoking a word with deep resonance in the Christian faith. As he stands before them, many see not a man, but a leader sent from heaven to rule a nation created by God. This is not the acceptance of a nomination. This is the acclamation of his coming victory. “Together we will launch a new era of safety, prosperity and freedom for citizens of every race, religion, color and creed,” Trump says. “The discord and division in our society must be healed. … We rise together, or we fall apart. I am running to be president for all America, not half of America.” For almost 10 minutes he follows the script of unity and reconciliation promised by his campaign in the wake of the assassination attempt, and the folks in the crowd — including dozens wearing their own ear bandages in solidarity — nod along. Then he will ramble off into another hour and 20 minutes of accusations, grievances and falsehoods leaving even stalwarts looking at their watches. But before he spins into that untethered space, he tells the story no showman could resist. A beautiful afternoon filled with bullets and blood. An audience not running from the mortal threat but standing firm as their leader sank. That leader rising — unbowed. “I’m not supposed to be here tonight. I’m not supposed to be here,” he says solemnly. “Yes, you are!” the crowd shouts back again and again. “Thank you, but I’m not,” Trump says, shaking his head and shifting from wrestler to penitent. “I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of almighty God.” He and his fans seize the passion. They bask in the pageantry. But even though Trump is casting himself as the martyr, within days it will seem he was playing the prophet.

23,"Harris hopes Ellipse speech will recall Trump’s chaos, but also evoke her own promise","As advisers to Vice President Kamala Harriswere mulling where to stagethe final major address of her campaign, they had a few boxes to check. The venue, they believed, must convey a degree of gravity about the choice before voters. But equally important, in their view, was its ability to evokethe promise of the office she seeks. In the Ellipse – the patch of park whereDonald Trumprallied his supporters on January 6, 2021, within view of the White House – they believe they found that equilibrium. “It’s really a reminder of the gravity of the job, how much a president can do for good and for bad, to shape the country and impact people’s lives,” Jennifer O’Malley Dillon, the campaign chair, said Tuesday. “But it’s also a stark visualization of probably the most infamous example of Donald Trump and how he’s used his power for bad, really focusing on himself and spreading division and chaos and inciting a mob to try to maintain his own power and put himself over the country.” For Harris, striking a balance between dire warnings about a rival she calls a fascist and forward-looking optimism about the president she would be has become a defining challenge of the campaign’s closing stretch. Tuesday’s high-profile speech is one of the last remaining opportunities for the vice president to try to reach a critical segment of the electorate known inside the campaign as “conflicted voters,” aides said, or those who may have concerns with Trump’s conduct but who are not yet convinced Harris is a candidate of change who can get the country on track. While it’s hard to imagine that one speech could move the needle, aides said, it is also intended to draw a clear contrast with Trump’scontroversial Madison Square Gardenrally Sunday evening. That was not the original intent of Harris’ major address, aides said, but they believe it serves as a timely rebuttal. “It’s going to crystallize many of the key arguments that she started with,” according to a source familiar with Harris’ speech, citing reproductive freedom and her framing of what she calls an “opportunity economy.” Despite the sober overtones of the setting – it is where Trump told his supporters to march to the Capitol on January 6; many did, causing destruction and death – Harris’ advisers say the speech will be hopeful and optimistic, and not focused exclusively on the events that unfolded at the site nearly four years ago. If there is a takeaway from that day she wants to drive home, it is that her own victory would turn the page on Trump’s divisiveness, according to advisers. With the office she is seeking to occupy 500 yards to the north, the setting provides Harris an opportunity to describe her plans for country, principallyon the economy, the top issue for voters. In the final week of the campaign, the speech isn’t intended to cover entirely new ground, aides said, but rather to frame the stakes of the race and highlight the deep contrast between Harris and Trump. Standing on the Ellipse, aides said, will allow Harris to bring familiar arguments about democracy to life in a setting that explicitly highlights the lengths that Trump and his allies went to try to overturn the 2020 election. The venue will also underscore how she believes a second term could be worse, they said. “As I’ve said many times and I’ll say tomorrow night in my speech, there’s a big difference between he and I. If he were elected on Day 1, he’s going to be sitting in the Oval Office working on his enemies list,” Harris said Monday. “On Day 1, if I’m elected president of the United States, which I fully intend to be, I will be working on behalf of the American people on my to-do list.” Preparations were underway on Monday ahead of the speech, including the installation of tall black fencing to create a secure perimeter around the Ellipse. An amended permit for the event showed as many as 40,000 people are expected to attend, with spillover onto the National Mall – her first major campaign speech outdoors in Washington. Most of Harris’ large rallies this year have been in arenas or stadiums in battleground states. The vice president worked on her remarks as she traveled to Michigan on Monday for three campaign stops, aides said, working through final drafts for one of the biggest speeches since the Democratic convention. She also is expected to address the economy, lowering the cost of prescription drugs, and her broader middle-class agenda, even though the sharpest contrasts are likely to come on Trump’s character. In some ways, it harks back to Harris’ remarks at campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, the day after PresidentJoe Bidendropped out of the race, making Tuesday’s speech something of a bookend in her extraordinarily truncated campaign. “All of this is to say building up the middle class will be a defining goal of my presidency,” Harris said at the time. “Because we here know, when our middle class is strong, America is strong.” Aides have likened Tuesday’s speech to the closing arguments Harris delivered as a prosecutor early in her career. After laying out evidence for a jury — in this case, voters — she is hoping to tie the various threads together into a single case for herself. She hasn’t been lacking in advice. As they have been since Biden was the party’s standard-bearer, Democrats are somewhat divided on how much to emphasize Trump’s character and perceived danger to democracy versus more narrowly focusing on pocketbook issues. Last week, the leading super PAC supporting Harris’ candidacy raised concerns that the Harris campaign was too closely centering its closing message on calling Trump a fascist. “This topic is not as persuasive as contrast messages featuring Harris’ economic plans, and her promise to protect reproductive rights,” the group warned in an email to Democrats about messaging in the final stretch of the campaign. Still, Harris’ advisers believe there are moderates who will be swayed by the links between Trump and fascism, particularly whenraised by his former top aide, John Kelly. More broadly, the Harris team views the closing days of the campaign as a moment to harness widespread exhaustion and frustration at Trump’s chaotic brand of politics, not only by shining a spotlight on the tumult but also by offering a clear alternative. Since the moment Harris ascended to the top of the ticket in July, her campaign has worked to capitalize on the trappings of office – and the power of strong imagery – to help voters see her as presidential and take the historic step of electing the first woman as commander in chief. The sweeping backdrop of the White House and the National Mall was designed for maximum effect a week before the final day of voting. It’s something of an analogue to an August rally in Detroit, where Harris spoke to thousands before the majestic backdrop of Air Force Two. The prime-time speech on the Ellipse comes amid rising anxiety from some over how much time Harris is devoting to disqualify Trump compared with what she would do if elected. The Tuesday night address, advisers tell CNN, is intended to be a balance of both messages. “We don’t have the luxury of just talking about what she would do as president,” a top Democratic adviser said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss strategic decisions. “We can’t pretend this is an ordinary election.”",Not Found

25,The latest on the war in the Middle East,"• Israel’s parliament defied international criticism to pass lawsbanning the UN’s relief agency for Palestiniansfrom operating in the country, a move that could havedevastating consequencesfor millions of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. • The Gaza health ministry says a total of93 people were killedfollowing an airstrike in northern Gaza. The strike hit a five-story building in Beit Lahiya on Tuesday morning. Separately,Israeli strikes in eastern Lebanonkilled at least 60 people and wounded dozens, according to Lebanese authorities. • Hezbollah has namedNaim Qassemas its new secretary-general following Israel’s killing of Hassan Nasrallah last month, said in a statement Tuesday. Qassem was previously Hezbollah’s second in command. • South Africa hassubmitted evidencefor its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice, South Africa’s presidency said in astatement Monday. Israel has strongly refuted the claims. Hours after Hezbollah chose Naim Qassem as its new leader, Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has posted a photograph of him on X with the caption: “Temporary appointment. Not for long.” The post followed Hezbollah’s announcement that its senior council had elected Qassem as the group’s new secretary-general following Israel’s killing of Hassan Nasrallah last month. Meanwhile, Israeli troops in southern Lebanon continue operations to dismantle and destroy Hezbollah infrastructure, according to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). The IDF said Tuesday that an underground command center and a site containing half a ton of explosives had been destroyed. “The infrastructure was excavated by Hezbollah several years ago at the heart of the civilian population of a village in southern Lebanon. The infrastructure and explosives were neutralized and destroyed,” the IDF said. Four Israeli soldiers were killed and one severely injured in the northern Gaza Strip on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement. The troops who died were between the ages of 20 and 22, according to the IDF. Israel began a renewed ground and air campaign in northern Gaza at the beginning of the month. During that offensive, scores of Palestinians have been killed and many more injured. Also on Tuesday, at least 93 people, including 25 children, were killed in an airstrike in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza, according to the health ministry in the strip. The Ministry of Health in Gaza has said that the number of people killed in an airstrike early Tuesday in Beit Lahiya has risen to 93, adding that 25 children are among the dead. The ministry had previously said that 77 people were killed or missing in the strike in northern Gaza. According to local journalists, some bodies are being buried immediately in makeshift graves because official burial places are too dangerous to access. One video showed the preparation of a mass burial site in a local market place. One man, Abu Mohammad Abu Naser, who said he was in a building that was hit, added that there were about 200 people inside, including children and the elderly. He said he had lost his wife and four children, as well as his father and siblings. “Everyone is gone,” Abu Naser said. He added that most of the occupants were displaced members of one extended family. CNN is reaching out to the Israel military for comment on the target of the strike. It began a renewed ground and air campaign in northern Gaza at the beginning of the month. Around 50 projectiles crossed from southern Lebanon into Israeli territory on Tuesday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said, adding that some were intercepted while others impacted. The projectiles crossed as sirens sounded in Israel’s Upper and Western Galilee areas between 10:37 and 10:39 a.m. local time (4:37 and 4:39 a.m. ET), the IDF said. One man was killed in the attack in the northern city of Ma’alot-Tarshiha, Israel’s emergency service Magen David Adom (MDA) reported. There was “huge destruction” at the scene, an MDA medic said. This post and headline have been updated with additional information. The Gaza health ministry has said 77 people were killed or are missing following an air strike in northern Gaza. The strike hit a five-story building in Beit Lahiya at around 6:30 a.m. local time (12:30 a.m. ET) on Tuesday. Video from the scene shows the building almost destroyed. Other videos show more than a dozen bodies wrapped in shrouds on the ground or loaded into a cart. Gaza Civil Defense said many displaced families were sheltering in the building. The health ministry said there were no doctors to treat the wounded in Kamal Adwan Hospital, which has also come under Israeli fire in recent days. The director of Kamal Adwan hospital, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya, told CNN: “We need a safe corridor for medical teams to arrive as quickly as possible. We have children in the intensive care unit who need amputations.” The Hamas-run government media office in Gaza claimed that many of the victims in Beit Lahiya were women and children. CNN is trying to confirm casualty numbers but communications with northern Gaza are at best intermittent. CNN is reaching out to the Israel Defense Forces for comment on the target of the strike. The Israeli military began a renewed ground and air campaign in northern Gaza at the beginning of the month. Iranian government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani announced that the country’s military budget will see a 200% increase, according to the semi-official Iranian news agency Tasnim. Earlier this week, while presenting his first budget to the Iranian parliament, President Masoud Pezeshkian pledged to boost military spending, citing the “regional situation” as justification. The spending increase comes as Iran-allied militias in the region, long seen as part of its deterrence architecture, become significantly degraded by Israel. This year, Iran and Israel launched direct attacks on each other’s territory for the first time. In the latest exchange, Israel struck Iran on Saturday, killing four troops and one civilian. All contact between Israeli officials and the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) will end in three months from Monday, when Israel’s parliament passed a bill banning the organization, according to the published law. Israel’s parliament, the Knesset, voted Monday to ban the nearly eight-decade-old United Nations agency that provides essential services for Palestinian refugees, a move that could have devastating consequences for millions of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. The Knesset passed two bills; one barring UNRWA from activity in Israel, and another banning Israeli authorities from any contact with UNRWA – revoking a 1967 treaty that allows UNRWA to provide services to Palestinian refugees in areas under Israel’s control. The 1967 treaty will expire within seven days of the bill’s passing, as Israel’s foreign minister makes the UN aware of its intention to terminate the treaty, according to the published law. South Africa has submitted evidence for its genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), South Africa’s presidency said in astatement Monday. The document, which will not be made public, contains more than 750 pages of evidence supported by exhibits and annexes of over 4,000 pages, the statement said. South Africa in Decemberaccused Israel of violatinginternational laws on genocide during its war in Gaza and has asked the court to order Israel to stop the war. The evidence “shows how the government of Israel has violated the Genocide Convention by promoting the destruction of Palestinians living in Gaza, physically killing them with an assortment of destructive weapons, depriving them access to humanitarian assistance,” the presidency said. Israel has strongly rejected South Africa’s claims, and in May said it was an “obscene exploitation” of the “most sacred” Genocide Convention. It has argued that it is engaged in a “difficult and tragic” armed conflict, which is essential to “comprehend the situation.” The catastrophic situation at a hospital in northern Gaza deepened on Tuesday as dozens of casualties arrived following an Israeli airstrike, according to one of just two remaining doctors at the facility. Hussam Abu Safiya, a pediatrician and director of the Kamal Adwan hospital, said 15 bodies and 35 wounded people had been brought to the medical center in the past few hours, but added they could only receive limited treatment due to desperate shortages of supplies following weeks of Israeli bombardment. “The situation has been extremely catastrophic since 6 a.m.,” Abu Safiya told CNN. “We stand helpless, watching them die before our eyes, with no resources to assist them.” The chaotic scene was compounded by the separate bombing of a house next to the hospital, he added. “Injured individuals are arriving at the hospital around the clock without pause,” Abu Safiya said. Some 57 medical workers were arrested by the Israeli military in a raid on the hospital last week, Abu Safiya said, leaving himself, another pediatrician and a few nurses as the only remaining medical staff. Abu Safiya said they were ill-equipped to deal with the constant arrival of patients with critical injuries and he urged the international community to open a humanitarian corridor to allow medical supplies, staff and ambulances to reach the hospital. “Imagine people arriving on donkey carts, the scene is horrific,” he said, as he accused Israel of committing genocide in Gaza. “This is a true collective massacre, genocide, and what is happening now is a catastrophe in every sense of the word,” he said. Israel has previously denied allegations of genocide in Gaza. On Monday an Israeli military official said troops raided Kamal Adwan hospital last week following “significant fighting” around the facility. Israeli forces detained “more than 100 Hamas terrorists” and found weapons and ammunition on the hospital grounds, the official said. CNN cannot independently verify the claims. On Tuesday, Abu Safiya said the weapons found at the hospital belonged to security staff who had abandoned them during the raid. Hezbollah has named Naim Qassem as its new secretary-general following Israel’s killing of Hassan Nasrallah last month, the group’s media office said in a statement on Tuesday. Hezbollah’s Senior Council said the decision was made in accordance with its process for selecting leadership. Qassem is committed to prophet “Mohammed’s authentic Islam” and the core principles of Hezbollah, the statement said. Qassem was previously Hezbollah’s second in command. Earlier this month, hecalled on Israelisto accept a ceasefire in Lebanon or face “pain,” as the group changed its strategy to strike harder and deeper into Israel. The void created by Israel’s ban on the United Nations’ relief agency for Palestinian refugees will be too big to fill by other UN bodies, a top UNRWA official said. Sam Rose, UNRWA’s senior deputy director of affairs in Gaza, said that laws passed Monday by Israel’s parliament prohibiting the UN agency from operating in the country would be devastating for the Palestinian enclave following more than a year of Israeli bombardment. Earlier, Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon told Coren that Israel would work with other UN agencies like UNICEF and independent NGOs to provide aid to Gazans. “There is no future for UNRWA Gaza,” Danon said, as he reiterated Israeli allegations that the UN agency had been infiltrated by Hamas. The UN fired nine UNRWA staff in August over accusations by Israel that they were involved in Hamas’ October 7 attacks. However, the UN said it could not independently authenticate Israel’s allegations. Rose said the accusations against a handful of UNRWA staff should not derail the entire organization, which he called the “lifeblood” of the humanitarian operation in Gaza. UNRWA has 13,000 personnel in Gaza, who provide services including food, shelter, education and health care, Rose said. “My staff today will continue to go to work as they have done every day for the past 13 months, but the future right now seems very, very uncertain, sadly,” he said. Israel’s parliament has defied international pressure toapprove a ban on the United Nations’ Palestinian refugee agency, in a move the UN chief warned could have “devastating consequences” for millions of Palestinian refugees living in areas under Israel’s control. The Knesset’s move follows an intense Israeli campaign to delegitimize UNRWA as the Jewish state’s relations with the UN have reached an all-time low amid the ongoing war in Gaza. Israel previouslyaccused UNRWA staffof taking part in Hamas’ October 7 attack, which the agency strongly denied. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes in eastern Lebanon killed dozens of people in some of the deadliest attacks of the Israel-Hezbollah war, Lebanese officials said. Here’s what you need to know. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu did not receive a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal proposal, according to his spokesperson, following the resumption of high-level negotiations. CNN previously reported thatEgypt on Sunday proposeda two-day ceasefire in Gaza that would facilitate the swap of four Israeli hostages held in the enclave for an unspecified number of Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. Israel’s ban on the United Nations’ Palestinian refugee agency could have “devastating consequences,” the UN chief warned on Monday. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres’ remarks come after the Israeli parliament passed two bills: one barring the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees from activity within Israel, and another banning Israeli authorities from any contact with UNRWA in a move that’s expected to severely restrict the vital agency from operating in territories Israel occupies. “The implementation of the laws could have devastating consequences” for Palestinian refugees in the occupied Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, “which is unacceptable,” Guterres said in a statement. UNRWA, which began by assisting about 750,000 Palestinian refugees in 1950, now serves almost 6 million across the Middle East, including in East Jerusalem, Gaza, and the West Bank, providing basic needs including food, education, and medical services. The UN chief also urged Israel to abide by its obligations under international law. “National legislation cannot alter those obligations,” he said. UNRWA was established by the United Nations after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war to provide humanitarian assistance for displaced Palestinians. Those who fit that definition and their descendantsnow number 5.9 million, all of whom are considered eligible for UNRWA support. Israel has rejected the possibility of allowing the displaced Palestinians to return home, arguing that the move would change the country’s Jewish character. Since its establishment, the United Nations’ General Assembly – a voting body of all member states – has repeatedly renewed UNRWA’s mandate. The agency has provided aid to four generations of Palestine refugees, according to its website, covering education, health care, camp infrastructure, social services and emergency assistance, including in times of conflict. UNRWA ban:Israel’s move to ban UNRWA follows its intense campaign to delegitimize the agency as the Jewish state’s relations with the UN have reached an all-time low amid the war in Gaza. Israel previouslyaccused UNRWA staffof taking part in Hamas’ October 7 attack, which the agency strongly denied. Several governments, including the United States, suspended funding for the agency while the allegations were being investigated. In January, UNRWA terminated the contracts of those Israel named and launched an investigation into its claims. Most nations have since restored funding with the exception of the US, its biggest donor. UNRWA said that that as of October 20 of this year,233of its workers had been killed during the ongoing conflict. Israel’s ban on the agency could have “devastating consequences,” the UN chief has warned. Successive Israeli strikes in eastern Lebanon Monday night killed at least 60 people and wounded 58, the country’s health ministry said in a preliminary casualty count. The strikes are among the deadliest in Lebanon since the Israel-Hezbollah conflict escalated last month. They targeted multiple cities and towns in the Baalbek-Hermel and Bekaa governorates, the ministry added. Baalbek-Hermel Gov. Bachir Khodr called it the “most violent day in Baalbek since the beginning of the aggression.” CNN has reached out to the Israeli military for comment. Remember:Israellaunched a ground offensivein Lebanon earlier this month as part of its intensifying conflict with the Iran-backed paramilitary group Hezbollah. Israel has bombed what it says are Hezbollah targets in Lebanon at anunprecedented intensity, displacing over 1 million people and killing more than 2,000 since mid-September, according to the Lebanese government. Israel’s parliament hasvoted to ban a nearly eight-decade-old United Nations agencythat provides essential services for Palestinian refugees.

Prior to the vote, the US State Department had urged Israel not to pass the legislation, saying the agency plays “an irreplaceable role right now in Gaza.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken had previously warned Israel that passing the legislation could “have implications under US law and US policy.” Israel has long sought to dismantle the UN body, arguing that some of its employees are affiliated with Hamas, and that its schools teach hate against Israel. UNRWA hasrepeatedly denied these accusations, saying there is “absolutely no ground for a blanket description of ‘the institution as a whole’ being ‘totally infiltrated.’” Read more about UNRWA and the implications of the Israeli ban. Iran and Israel have demanded the United Nations Security Council take action – against each other. Envoys to the UN from both countries addressed a meeting of the Security Council Monday, each of them blaming the other for the recent increase in tensions that saw Iran launch around 180 missiles at Israel at the beginning of October and Israel retaliate with airstrikes on Iran on Saturday. He also warned that Iran reserved the right to respond to Israel’s attack at a time of its choosing. For his part, Israeli Ambassador to the UN Danny Danon warned that any further act of aggression from Iran would have consequences. He urged the Security Council to impose sanctions on Iran’s military and economic infrastructure, and to take measures to prevent the country from obtaining “nuclear capabilities.” Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has laid out Israel’s determination to ultimately triumph over its greatest foe, Iran, and even bolster its standing in the Middle East through peace deals with Arab countries when the war in Gaza ends. Addressing the Israeli parliament on Monday, Netanyahu said that according to Iran’s plan, “If Israel falls – the entire Middle East will fall into its hands.” The Israeli leader also revealed a new future goal for Israel: pursuing peace deals with more Arab countries. Some background:Before the ongoing round of conflict, Israel had been engaged in intensive diplomatic efforts to reset its relations with certain Arab states. The pinnacle of this engagement was theAbraham Accords, high-profile normalization agreements signed with Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in 2020. More than 1,000 people have been killed since Israel began a large-scale military incursion into northern Gaza earlier this month, according to the Gaza Civil Defense. In addition to those killed, many others are lying beneath the rubble or on the streets, Basal added. Spokesperson Mahmoud Basal said intense Israeli bombardment has been continuous for 22 days in Jabalya, Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun, among other areas, adding that Israeli forces have also prevented the civil defense and medical staff from accessing that part of the territory.",Global
26,Israel has banned the UN agency for Palestinian refugees. That could be devastating for millions,"Israel’s parliament has voted to ban a nearly eight-decade-old United Nations agency that provides essential services for Palestinian refugees, a move that could have devastating consequences for millions of Palestinians living under Israeli occupation. On Monday, the Knesset passed two bills; one barring UNRWA from activity within Israel, and another banning Israeli authorities from any contact with UNRWA – revoking the 1967 treaty that allows UNRWA to provide services to Palestinian refugees in areas under Israel’s control. The move is expected to severely restrict the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) from operating in territories Israel occupies. Following the passing of the first law, Boaz Bismuth, a member of Likud, the architect of the bill, said: “Anyone that behaves like a terrorist has no rights in Israel…. UNRWA equals Hamas, period.” The move went ahead despite heated opposition from Arab members of the Knesset and strong international pressure from Western nations. The first law was approved with 92 votes in favor, 10 against. The second was approved with 87 votes in favor, 9 against. The vote was swiftly criticized by UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini, who said it violated international law and was “the latest in the ongoing campaign to discredit UNRWA and delegitimize its role toward providing human-development assistance and services to Palestine refugees.” Several countries, including the United States, have expressed deep concerns about the controversial ban, which could impact the education, food, healthcare and livelihoods of millions of Palestinians who depend on the agency. Prior to the vote, the US State Department had urged Israel not to pass the legislation, saying the agency plays “an irreplaceable role right now in Gaza.” Secretary of State Antony Blinken has previously warned Israel that passing the legislation could “have implications under US law and US policy.” Despite those widely expressed concerns, during the passing of the laws, Knesset member Yuli Edelstein said the move would “not in any way harm humanitarian aid to the Gaza Strip” and insisted Israel was acting within the framework of international law. Israel has long sought to dismantle the UN body, arguing that some of its employees are affiliated with Hamas, and that its schools teach hate against Israel. UNRWA hasrepeatedly denied these accusations, saying there is “absolutely no ground for a blanket description of ‘the institution as a whole’ being ‘totally infiltrated.’” Here’s what we know about UNRWA, and the implications of the Israeli ban. UNRWA was founded by the United Nations a year after the 1948 creation of Israel that led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their homes in an event known by Palestinians as the “Nakba” (catastrophe). The agency, which began by assisting about 750,000 Palestinian refugees in 1950, now servessome 5.9 millionacross the Middle East, many of whom live in refugee camps in the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem as well as in Jordan, Lebanon, Syria. In the Gaza Strip, which has been ravaged by a devastating Israeli war for more than a year, UNRWA serves some 1.7 million Palestinian refugees. In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, it assists around871,500 refugees. The agency provides a wide range of aid and services to Palestinian refugees and their descendants, including shelter, healthcare, food and education. It is also a major source of employment for the refugees, who make up most of its more than30,000 employees across the Middle East,and has representative offices in New York, Geneva and Brussels. More than 13,000 of its employeesare stationed in Gaza alone. In the West Bank and East Jerusalem, it employs nearly4,000 workers. UNRWA is uniquein that it is the only UN agency dedicated to a specific group of refugees in specific areas. While its purpose is to support Palestinian refugees, UNRWA does not have a mandate to resettle them The UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) is the body that is tasked with resettlement of refugees, but its mandate does not extend to areas UNRWA operates in. Israel has long opposed the agency and sought to dismantle it even before October 7 last year, when Hamas-led militants killed 1,200 people in Israel and took more than 250 hostages. Israeli officials have rejected UNRWA’s definition of which Palestinians are eligible for refugee status, arguing that descendants of the 1948 refugees do not qualify and thus don’t have the right to return to their ancestral homes in what is now Israel. An Israeli member of parliamentbehind the bills accused UNRWA on Sunday of “educating kids to hate Israel and spreading antisemitism.” “UNRWA… is selling them (Palestinians) stories that they will be able to come back to Israel. This will not happen,” Yulia Malinovsky, a lawmaker for the Israel Beitenu party told CNN Sunday. But since the war started, Israel has launched an intense campaign to delegitimize the UN body, including accusingsome of UNRWA’s employeesof association with Hamas’ attack, alleging they took part in varying capacities. UNRWA strongly denied the allegations, but several governments, including the US, suspended funding for the agency earlier this year while the allegations were being investigated. In January, the agency terminated the contracts of those Israel named and launched an investigation into its claims. Most nations have since restored funding with the exception of the US, its biggest donor. UNRWA said that that as of October 20 of this year,233of its workers were killed. And last month, the agency said that anUNRWA staffer “was shotand killed on the roof of his home by a sniper during an overnight Israeli military operation” in El Far’a Camp in the occupied West Bank, marking the first time a member of the UN agency was killed in the West Bank in more than 10 years, UNRWA said. UN Secretary-General António Guterressaid earlier this monththat “in midst of all the upheaval, UNRWA – more than ever – is indispensable… is irreplaceable.” The UN chief said he sent a letter to Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu, telling him that the proposed bill would “suffocate efforts to ease human suffering and tensions in Gaza, and indeed, the entire Occupied Palestinian Territory.” “It would be a catastrophe,” Guterres said, “in what is already an unmitigated disaster.” But his calls appear to have fallen on deaf ears. The UN chief has been declared persona-non-grata, or an unwanted person, by Israel, whose officials have repeatedly accused Guterres of being sympathetic to Israel’s adversaries. UNRWA is the primary humanitarian aid group in Gaza. Nearly 2 million Gazans rely on the agency for aid, with 1 million people using UNRWA shelters for food and healthcare in the enclave. The agency has provided Gazans with everything from food and healthcare to education and psychological support for decades. Along with the Palestinian Red Crescent, UNRWA handles almost all distribution of UN aid coming into the territory. The agency has 11 food distribution centers for 1 million people in Gaza,more than half of whomUNRWA assesses to live below the abject poverty line of US$ 1.74 per person per day. The agency has also helped implement an emergency polio vaccination campaign in Gaza, alongside other UN bodies, in a bid to stop the infectious virus that can cause paralysis from spreading.Last week, the third phaseof the polio vaccination campaign in Gaza was postponed due to escalating violence in north Gaza, the World Health Organization (WHO) said. In the West Bank, UNRWA provides services for 19 refugee camps,more than 90 schoolsand a number of health services, including prenatal care. It distributes basic food supplies, loans, as well as emergencycash grantsandshelter, according to the agency’s website. It is unclear who would assume assistance for the millions of Palestinian refugees who rely on UNRWA, if it wasn’t able to. Israel has previously tried to dismantle the agency and called for the merging of its responsibilities with the UNHCR. The US State Department told CNN that the ban would make it impossible for UNRWA to operate and would leave a “vacuumthat Israel would then be responsible for filling.” Aida Touma-Suleiman, an Israeli-Arab politician and member of the Arab-majority Hadash party, said the “bills stem from a long time ambition of the Israeli right – to strip Palestinian refugees from their status.” “Israel is in effect creating new refugees every day while questioning the legitimacy of that very status,”Touma-Suleiman said on X. On Monday, foreign ministersof seven countries – Canada, Australia, France, Germany, Japan, South Korea and the United Kingdom – called on Israel to halt the legislation, expressing “grave concern” over its implications. “UNRWA provides essential and life-saving humanitarian aid and basic services to Palestinian refugees in Gaza, East Jerusalem, the West Bank and throughout the region,” the foreign ministers said in a joint statement. Despite its suspension of funding to UNRWA, the US has also opposed the ban. In a letter sent to two senior members of the Israeli government earlier this month, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said the Biden administration was “deeply concerned” about it.",Global
27,Russia claims control of key town of Selydove in Ukraine’s Donetsk region,"The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Tuesday it had taken the Ukrainian town of Selydove, southeast of the key city of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region. Russian forces have been advancing on Selydove in the last several weeks, according to frontline reports. It’s part of Russia’s ongoing assault and incremental territorial gains in eastern Ukraine. Selydove was an important staging area for Ukraine’s defenses and a key foothold to prevent Russia’s advance toward Pokrovsk. Ukrainian authorities have not yet commented on Russia’s claims of control. On Sunday, a spokesman for a Ukrainian national guard brigade fighting in Selydove told CNN the town had been “constantly attacked from several directions” for a week. “[Russia] continues to assault with very large troop numbers. They used reserves from the north of the frontline’s Pokrovsk section to increase pressure on Selydove,” 15th brigade national guard spokesman Vitaliy Milovidov said. “At the same time, the enemy is not destroying the city’s infrastructure,” he added. “Most likely, they want to keep the town as a foothold for themselves in the future. Selydove is a large town where you can accommodate a large number of people and hide equipment.” Video released by Russian state media TASS on Tuesday reportedly shows troops raising the Russian flag in Selydove. Russia also continued aerial assaults on Ukrainian cities overnight into Tuesday. At least nine Ukrainian people were killed and 46 injured across the country as Russian forces attacked the cities of Kharkiv, Kryvyi Rih and the capital Kyiv. In the Odesa region, a 71-year-old man was killed by falling debris following an intercepted Russian missile strike launched by a fighter jet from the Black Sea. In Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, a Russian bomb destroyed much of the Derzhprom building, one of themost celebrated landmarks, which is considered a cultural monument due to its modernist architecture. This is a developing story and will be updated.",Not Found
28,"North Korean soldiers learning Russian commands and may be sent to Ukraine front lines, South Korean lawmakers say","North Korean soldiers may be being readied for a move to the front lines ofRussia’s war against Ukraineafter being taught basic Russian commands, South Korean lawmakers told reporters on Tuesday, citing the country’s intelligence officials. About 10,000North Korean soldiersare receiving military training in eastern Russia, the Pentagon estimated on Monday – up from a previous estimate of 3,000by the White House. South Korea’s National Intelligence Service (NIS) is now watching for the possibility of “some North Korean personnel, including high-ranking military officials, movingto the front lines,” said lawmakers Lee Seong-kweun and Park Sun-won, who were briefed by the NIS during a closed-door meeting of a parliamentary intelligence committee. Russia is teaching North Korean soldiers about 100 basic military words like “fire” and “in position,” the lawmakers said. However, they added, it’s clear that North Korean soldiers are struggling to communicate – and it’s not clear whether they’ll be able to bridge the language gap. North Korea has also stepped up its security measures – both to protect its dictator Kim Jong Un and to prevent news of the North Korean deployments to Russia from spreading within the highly isolated, impoverished country. To this end, North Korean officers involved in the Russian effort are banned from using phones, while families of soldiers are told that their loved ones are simply participating in a “military exercise,” the lawmakers said. Despite these measures, word has spread within North Korea of deployments to Russia – sparking “unrest” in some parts of the country, the lawmakers said. Some residents and soldiers have voiced fears of possibly being sent to Russia themselves, while others have questioned why they are being sacrificed for a different country, they added. Last week, Ukraine interceptedRussian transmission channels and released audio, with Russian soldiers heard talking disdainfully about the incoming North Korean soldiers, calling them the “K Battalion” and referring to them as “the f**king Chinese.” The intercepts also reveal plans to have one interpreter and three senior officers for every 30 North Korean men, which the Russian soldiers are heard in the audio condemning. “The only thing I don’t understand is that there [should be] three senior officers for 30 people. Where do we get them? We’ll have to pull them out,” one Russian serviceman says. This could mark the first time North Korea makes a significant intervention in an international conflict. North Korea has one of the world’s largest militaries with 1.2 million soldiers, but most of its troops lack combat experience. The Kremlin had initially dismissed allegations of North Korean troop deployments, but at the BRICS summit in Russia last week, President Vladimir Putin did not deny that Pyongyang had sent soldiers to the country. North Korea said on Friday that any troop deployment to Russia to aid the war in Ukraine would conform with international law, state media reported, without explicitly confirming such presence. North Korea had previously dismissed such reports. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui is now in Russia for her second trip there in six weeks, having departed Pyongyang on Monday. She likely traveled to discuss potentially dispatching more North Korean troops – and what Pyongyang would receive in return, the lawmakers told reporters. The news also comes as South Korea’s foreign and defense ministers head to Washington to speak with their counterparts, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, for an annual ministerial meeting.",Global
29,Russia bombs historic Soviet skyscraper in Ukraine’s Kharkiv,"A Russian guided bomb attack on Kharkiv on Monday shattered much of the Derzhprom building, one of the most celebrated landmarks in Ukraine’s second city, dating from the 1920s. Six people were injured in the 9 p.m. local time (3 p.m. ET) strike, adding to 13 wounded in an earlier overnight bomb attack on the city. In the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, a Russian missile struck a three-story residential building, killing one person and wounding at least 11. President Volodymyr Zelensky denounced the strike on Kharkiv’s Derzhprom (State Industry) building, one of the most striking examples of Soviet-era constructivism architecture and dubbed the Soviet Union’s first skyscraper. Writing on X, he also deplored the attack on Kryvyi Rih, his hometown, and called for renewed efforts to force Kremlin leader Vladimir Putin to halt the more than two-and-a-half-year-old war. “Every handshake with war criminal Putin boosts his confidence. Every pleasant smile convinces him that he can get away with his crimes,” Zelensky wrote. “Instead of cozying up to him, we must force him into peace through our collective decisiveness.” Reuters news agency video showed parts of the Derzhprom building reduced to rubble and virtually all of its windows shattered. “The occupiers have struck an iconic symbol of the city, known to all residents of Kharkiv,” Oleh Syniehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, wrote on Telegram. He said several floors had been destroyed. The Derzhprom building, placed on the “tentative” list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites, was completed in 1928 when Kharkiv was the capital of Soviet Ukraine. The evening attack also hit a medical facility. Earlier strikes damaged an apartment building and storage space. Eight  were hurt in the city of Chuhuiv just to the southeast, Syniehubov  said, an attack prosecutors said involved a multi rocket-launch system  was used in Chuhuiv.",Not Found
30,"As a child, he was kicked out of one of Macao’s finest hotels and vowed to take it over. Today, he’s the owner","Simon Sio grew up in humble surroundings in the heart of Macao, living in an old building directly across from what was then the city’s grandest accommodation, Hotel Central. Opened in 1928, it became a prestigious gathering place for celebrities and diplomats in the following decades. In the 1960s, young Sio would playfully sneak in – it was one of the few places in theformer Portuguese colonywith air conditioning, a vast, luxurious space compared to the old tenement buildings that surrounded it. But one day, he was thrown out. “As a kid, I didn’t know better,” Sio tells CNN. “I pointed at the hotel and swore I’d buy it someday.” Though countless children around the world have made similar vows in the face of perceived injustice, Sio is one of the few to actually follow through with one. The businessman, now 65, founded his own real estate development company, Lek Hang Group, in 1991. Fast forward to 2024 and Sio could recently be found cutting the ribbon to officially reopen the 96-year-old Hotel Central as its new owner. But he didn’t buy the hotel out of spite. Sio says he wanted to restore a piece of Macao’s disappearing history, an issue that’s close to his heart. In more recent years, luxurious resort complexes and skyscrapers have continuously popped up around Macao. In contrast, the sprawling alleys and old architecture along Avenida de Almeida Ribeiro, affectionately called San Ma Lo (translated as ‘The New Road’ in Cantonese) might not look all that exciting today. But when the road first opened in 1920, it instantly became the city’s most important thoroughfare. Hotel Central, formerly named the President Hotel, opened a few years later and became a key feature of the neighborhood. “If we talk about Macao’s history, we cannot neglect San Ma Lo. If we talk about San Ma Lo, we cannot neglect Hotel Central,” says Sio. The mint-colored seven-story hotel was the first building in Macao to have an elevator. In 1932, it became the first hotel in the city to have a two-floor casino. It was expanded to eight floors in 1938 and 11 floors in 1942, making it the tallest hotel in the city. However, by the 1960s, as competition intensified, Hotel Central began to lose its luster. “The giant watched me grow up like an elder,” says Sio. “So I had a deep emotional attachment to it. At its peak, it was my idol. As I became older, its decay made my heart uncomfortable. “Until today, Hotel Central exists as the tallest, largest building on San Ma Lo. I felt that it should embody its power at its fullest potential. So I kept my eye out for opportunities to restore it.” That opportunity finally came in the 2000s, when the hotel’s two owners decided to sell. In 2016, Sio completed a seven-year acquisition process and officially became the new owner of the hotel. That was the first step. Renovating a nearly 100-year-old building is a challenging endeavor, particularly since the additional floors added to Hotel Central in the 1930s and 1940s did not have proper foundation reinforcements. To complicate things further, the building and its adjacent area isa cultural heritagesite and situated withinthe UNESCO-listed historic center, meaning the company couldn’t alter or demolish some structures to fortify its base. “With nearly 100 years of history, the durability of the cement was limited, and it was clearly long past its prime condition,” says Sio. The team came up with multiple proposals based on what had been done in the past but none were feasible. In the end, Sio’s team had to invent a new piling method and tested their design multiple times at a construction site in China before setting out to work on Hotel Central. The developer also used new materials and technologies, such as digital sketching, to recreate the original look of the building. “We were the first in Macao to try our method,” says Sio. “When you have no experience, you have to take time for trial and error every step of the way…to stop and come up with solutions when we run into issues, to discuss together how to pivot, before we put in the work.” After overcoming numerous problems, construction finally began in 2019. Before long, yet another massive challenge got in the way: Covid-19. But the team soldiered on and the project topped out in 2022. “We’re all very proud to say that the project was successful in the end,” says Sio, noting that the cost of the restoration was approximately 400 million Macanese Pataca (about $50 million), while the total investment was around 2.2 billion Macanese Pataca (or about $274 million). The newly renovated Hotel Central has 114 rooms with a retro interior design inspired by the 1920s, 1930s and 1940s. A qipao rental service gives guests a chance to dress up in traditional clothing to match the vibe of the hotel. An exhibition called “Historical Cultural Corridor” on the ground floor is already open to the public. Still to come is a small shopping mall, which will sit on the first three floors of the hotel, though an opening date hasn’t been set. The hotel will also house a restaurant, a bakery and a rooftop bar overlooking the skyline of Macao on the top floor. For Sio, the project’s significance justifies every cent he invested. “Looking back, projects like Hotel Central on the market are relatively far and few, especially one with such an extensive history,” he says. “There’s a saying which I tell everyone around me: ‘Money can produce volume, but money cannot reproduce history.’” Sio hopes that Hotel Central inspires more developers to revitalize Macao’s historical sites and diversify the city’s tourism development beyond its glitzy casino resorts. “We hope that visitors will have a different view of Macao: Macao is not just the Cotai strip, Macao is so much more,” he says, referring to an area of the city that houses many of the newest and biggest casino resorts. Only then, he says, will Macao truly become a world-class tourist destination. But he says he feels positive about the future of Macao’s tourism industry, especially as the government has committed financial resources and invited gaming companies to join the effort to preserve the city’s history. MGM, which has two casino hotels in Macao, for example, will reportedly collaborate with the government to restore 13 run-down buildings in the 35,000-square-meter (378,000 square feet) Barra District and create an arts and recreation space. “With so much effort, I believe that we have a chance to produce a good result in a very short amount of time, so let’s wait and see,” says Sio. “Macao is small. We can’t grow in size. Thirty-three square kilometers is all we have… But small things can be exquisite. So we need to move in the direction of exquisiteness, like a jewel.”",Global
31,How the coldest place on Earth became one of the world’s hottest vacation spots,"It was a bright, sunny afternoon during the recent summer season in Antarctica when the Seabourn Pursuit cruise ship rammed into a sheet of sea ice in Hanusse Bay. The ship plowed forward, ice crumbling beneath its bow, until it was embedded several hundred yards into the frozen sea water. The 250 passengers on board the Pursuit went out on their balconies and leaned over the side of the decks to see what was happening. But there was no Titanic-like rush to the lifeboats. Instead, passengers went down to the gangway and began filing off the boat to take a walk around on the ice. This was no accident. It was a planned experience, complete with a table containing glasses of champagne to toast their arrival in Antarctica. Among the passengers strolling around on the ice sheet were Greg and Susana McCurdy, a pair of retired Las Vegas police officers. Susana is now a part-time travel agent, and the McCurdys are spending their retirement hitting as many exotic locations as they can. After grabbing their champagne glasses, the McCurdys unfurled a small banner that read “7thContinent Antarctica 2024,” and posed for a picture. With this trip, they had joined a small but expanding group of people who have stepped foot on every continent on the planet. Susana says she has seen a change among her clients recently. “They want more authentic, more bucket-list items, especially after Covid. They’re just not waiting anymore … And Antarctica is near the top of everyone’s list.” The surge in travel to Antarctica started well before the post-Covid travel boom. The International Association of Antarctica Tour Operators (IAATO) has been tracking the number of tourists to visit the white continent since the early 1990s. Back then, around 7,000 people would visit every year. The numbers have really exploded in the past half decade or so. In the winter of 2017, just under 44,000 tourists visited Antarctica. This year, that number surpassed 122,000 visitors. And they’re coming in such numbers because travel to the Earth’s coldest continent has never been easier — or more luxurious. A couple of decades ago, Antarctic travel meant visiting on smaller ships, many of them former “ice cutters” from Russia, Canada and other polar nations. It was anything but a luxury experience. Robin West, Seabourn’s vice president and general manager of expeditions, took his first trip to the region in 2002. He says many of the boats back then were equipped with bunk beds and shared bathrooms. “You put your name on a board for spaghetti or lasagna every night,” he said. Few of the ships even had windows to see outside. The experience today is quite different. Colleen McDaniel, editor-in-chief of Cruise Critic, credits Lindblad and National Geographic cruise lines with opening up Antarctic travel to more visitors about a decade ago. “They were really the pioneers in bringing the Antarctica experience to a more traditional traveler. But those initial sailings were less luxurious than we see today,” McDaniel said. “Lately Ponant, Silversea, Seabourn and Scenic have made huge leaps with that top-of-the market luxury experience, offering incredible onboard suites, exceptional dining and even spas. Cruise lines like Quark are creating products for adventure-seekers, offering things like cross-country skiing and camping.” The swelling tourism numbers have some experts sounding the alarm about the environmental impacts of the spike in visitors. A 2022 study published in the journalNaturefound that the snow in Antarctica is melting faster because of tourist visits to the continent. The black soot that comes out of cruise ship smokestacks settles on the ice and attracts sunlight, causing tons of snow to melt prematurely. Ecologists also say the growing human presence in Antarctica is causing carbon dioxide levels to spike in an area of the planet that is not used to it. Cruise ship operators say they are keenly aware of their environmental impact. Passengers receive detailed instruction about not bringing any outside food or other contaminants with them for Antarctic landings. They are instructed to never lie down in the snow and to maintain distance from animals to prevent human-borne bacteria and viruses from infecting the wildlife. The countries that conduct tourism and research in Antarctica have signed what is known as the Antarctic Treaty. It says thatno one should build permanent structuresin the area for tourist use. Put another way, there are no hotels in Antarctica. Recently, IAATO began keeping track of fuel consumption by cruise ships in the Antarctic region and some operators are now using electric propulsion when they can in an effort to cut down on soot and CO2 emissions. Meanwhile, cruise lines have invested billions of dollars in recent years on specially built luxury expedition ships. Both the Seabourn Pursuit and its sister ship, the Venture, feature a luxurious spa, nine restaurants and eight lounges and bars for the roughly 250 passengers on board.Each of the 132 cabins has large glass doors and a balcony, allowing travelers to easily stand outside as the majestic icebergs float by. For an extra fee, passengers can book a spot in one of the onboard submarines or explore the Antarctic waters in a kayak. And passengers need not worry about the frigid temperatures as they are given specially designed cold-weather gear guaranteed to keep them warm and dry as they wander among the penguins and seals. Lately, a new category of Antarctic travel has even cropped up. Operators including Celebrity, Norwegian and Princess now offer “cruise only” visits that allow passengers to see Antarctica without actually touching down on the pristine and fragile tundra. These visits often feature larger boats and are typically more affordable. IAATO says that back in 2017, about 7,000 passengers visited Antarctica on a “cruise only” voyage. This past season, that number topped 43,000, an increase of more than 500%. “These mainstream lines provide a more budget-friendly way to travel to the region – even if you’re not actually disembarking in Antarctica,” Cruise Critic’s McDaniel says. “And while you won’t be able to see penguins or seals as close as you would with a landing, you’ll still see them. You also might see whales and plenty of bird varieties.” Whether on one of the fancy new luxury boats or the cruise-only experience, a trip to Antarctica is a chance to see another world — from the majestic beauty of the icebergs and glaciers to the playful wanderings of the penguins — and it has never been easier to visit.",Global
32,JPMorgan Chase customers who committed a viral check fraud scheme may soon have to pay up,"So long to all that “free” money. Customers who allegedly withdrew money fraudulently from Chase Bank ATMs usingan illegal schemethat blew up on TikTok over the summer could soon have to cut hefty checks back to the bank. These people were able to withdraw funds by writing checks to themselves and immediately withdrawing funds before the checks bounced. Normally, the bank follows the industry standard of making a portion of any check available to customers before the fundsclear. However, a temporary glitch allowed customers to withdraw more substantial amounts than typically allowed before a check clears. Now the bank is suing four customers who allegedly owe the bank nearly $662,000, according to four lawsuits JPMorgan Chase Bank, Chase’s parent company, filed Monday in three federal courts. One case in Houston involves a “masked man” who allegedly deposited a $335,000 check to a defendant’s account. Chase says the defendant owes it $291,000 — the most across all four of the cases — the bank said Monday in a Texas filing. In all four cases, Chase said it reached out to the defendants demanding they “pay the amount of any overdraft along with any fees that apply.” However, the defendants have so far failed to do so, which the bankclaims is a violation of the deposit agreement customers have to sign when they open an account. Now, in addition to returning the funds they allegedly accessed illegally, Chase is demanding the defendants cover the bank’s legal fees and other expenses related to the cases. JPMorgan also filed lawsuits in Florida and California federal courts. “Fraud is a crime that impacts everyone and undermines trust in the banking system,” Drew Pusateri, a Chase spokesperson, said in an emailed statement to CNN. “We’re pursuing these cases and actively cooperating with law enforcement to make sure if someone is committing fraud against Chase and its customers, they’re held accountable.” Pusateri added that the bank is “open to pursuing other individuals or entities we believe engaged in bank fraud.” JPMorgan Chase is the biggest US bank by assets, with roughly $3.5 trillion.",Not Found

34,49ers lineman Nick Bosa crashes teammates’ interview to show support for Donald Trump with MAGA hat,"San Francisco 49ers star Nick Bosa crashed his teammates’ postgame interview on Sunday to show his support for former President Donald Trump in the 2024 presidential election with a hat emblazoned with Trump’s slogan: Make America Great Again. Following the49ers’ 30-24 victory over the Dallas Cowboys, 27-year-old Bosa interrupted the postgame interview with Brock Purdy, George Kittle and Isaac Guerendo by jogging between Purdy and NBC’s Melissa Stark before pointing to the message emblazoned on the front of his hat and then running away. “All right, Nick Bosa with a message there,” Stark said as Bosa jogged off camera. Speaking to reporters afterward and wearing a different hat, Bosa declined to elaborate on the moment. “I’m not going to talk too much about it, but I think that it’s an important time,” the four-time Pro Bowlersaidwhen asked about what he did. The presidential election between Trump, a Republican, and Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat, is on November 5 – a little more than a week after Sunday night’s game. CNN has reached out to the NFL about their policy on players making political statements. CNN has also reached out to the 49ers for comment. Bosa’s mom,Cheryl, appeared to support her son’s message, reposting a user’s Instagram Story of the moment with the message, “(Cheryl Bosa) you raised your boy right!! #BOSAFORTRUMP.” Bosa and Trump have long been connected,even beforehe was drafted by the 49ers with the second overall pick of the 2019 NFL Draft. During his time at Ohio State, Bosa had previously taken heat for some old political tweets, including tweets supporting Trump and a tweet where he called Colin Kaepernick, a former 49er, a “clown.” Bosa apologized for the remark, according to anNFL.com article from 2019. “I respect what (Kaepernick’s) done,” Bosa said at a news conference after being drafted in 2019. “If it empowers anybody, then he’s doing a good thing. I apologize for that.” Kaepernick started the movement of NFL playerskneelingfor the “Star-Spangled Banner” to protest police brutality and racism. Trumprailed againstKaepernick and other protesting players and called on the NFL to take punitive measures against them. Kaepernicklater filed suitagainst the NFL, accusing teams of colluding to keep him from playing, and settled earlier this year,accordingto his attorney. Bosa has since deleted the tweets, which ESPN said included the criticism of Kaepernick, as well asBeyoncéand the movie “Black Panther.” When asked in anESPN interviewwhy he deleted the posts, Bosa said, “I had to.” “There is a chance I might end up in San Francisco,” Bosa said. Upon Bosa being drafted into the NFL, Trump offered his support for the defensive end. “Congratulations to Nick Bosa on being picked number two in the NFL Draft. You will be a great player for years to come, maybe one of the best. Big Talent! San Francisco will embrace you but most importantly, always stay true to yourself.

35,Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs accused of sexually assaulting ‘Making the Band’ teen contestant and 10-year-old boy in new lawsuits,"Two new civil lawsuits have been filed againstSean “Diddy” Combsby anonymous male accusers who claim they were minors when they were sexually assaulted by the music mogul during auditions – one who claims he was 10 years old at the time. Combs said he denies the latest claims against him in a statement to CNN. The embattled musician and businessman, who is being held in custody in New York as he awaits his criminal trial, is now facing at least 27 civil cases. One John Doe states in his lawsuit that he auditioned for Combs in 2005 at a hotel in New York at age 10. He was given soda by Combs that he alleges was laced with drugs. According to the lawsuit, Combs then forced Doe to perform oral sex after he resisted. Doe lost consciousness and later woke up in tears with his pants undone and pain in his anus and buttocks, the lawsuit states. The other John Doe, in a separate lawsuit, states he was 17 in or around 2008 when he attended a three-day audition for the MTV competition series, “Making the Band.” Doe claims that on the first day of the audition, during a one-on-one interview, “Combs asked Plaintiff hypothetical questions about handling situations involving sexual pressure.” “As Combs described these scenarios, he began to sexually assault Plaintiff by touching Plaintiff both over and under his clothing, including groping and fondling his penis and instructing Plaintiff to undress,” according to the lawsuit. The lawsuit states that Combs emphasized his power to control Doe’s future in the music industry, stating that he had the ability to “make or break” his career. On the second day of auditions, Combs allegedly told the 17-year-old Doe that he needed to undress “to demonstrate the ability to embody a ‘sex idol’ persona.” “This encounter eventually escalated into Combs forcing the Plaintiff to perform oral sex on him, and Combs sodomizing the Plaintiff,” the lawsuit states. The following day, the complaint states, Combs and his bodyguard sexually assaulted Doe. He was then eliminated from the competition “as Combs claimed that Plaintiff was untrustworthy due to his reservations about performing oral sex on his bodyguard,” the lawsuit states. When reached by CNN for comment, Combs’ attorneys did not respond to the specific allegations in the two new lawsuits, but denied that Combs has ever sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone. “As we’ve said before, Mr. Combs cannot respond to every new publicity stunt, even in response to claims that are facially ridiculous or demonstrably false,” Combs’ attorneys said in a statement, in part. “Mr. Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process.  In court, the truth will prevail:  that Mr. Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone—man or woman, adult or minor.” The two new lawsuits were filed Monday in New York state court. Both accusers are represented by attorneys Tony Buzbee and co-counsel Andrew Van Arsdale, who said earlier this month that they are representing over 120 alleged victims who plan to go public with their claims against Combs. Since November 2023, more than two dozen civil lawsuits have been filed against Combs with allegations of sexual assault or misconduct. The initial lawsuit, filed by his former girlfriend Cassie Ventura, was settled the next day. The other cases remain active. Combs has denied the civil allegations. Federal prosecutors have accused Combs of orchestrating a “criminal enterprise” through his business empire that engaged in sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping and decades of physical abuse against women, among other allegations. He has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in prostitution. Combs’ criminal trial is tentatively set to begin in May 2025. Prosecutors have said their criminal investigation is ongoing and additional charges or defendants could be added in a possible superseding indictment.

36,Lost Chopin music uncovered in ‘thrilling’ discovery,"A curator at a museum in New York City has discovered a previously unknown waltz written byFrédéric Chopin, the first time that a new piece of work by the Polish composer has been found in nearly 100 years. The waltz, written on a small manuscript measuring about 4 inches by 5 inches, was first discovered by curator Robinson McClellan in 2019, who then sought outside expert help, according to a statement from the Morgan Library & Museum on Monday. “He found it peculiar that he could not think of any waltzes by Chopin that matched the measures on the page,” reads the statement. “Chopin famously wrote in ‘small forms,’ but this work, lasting about one minute, is shorter than any other waltz by him,” adds the statement. “It is nevertheless a complete piece, showing the kind of ‘tightness’ that we expect from a finished work by the composer.” McClellan asked Chopin expert Jeffrey Kallberg, associate dean for arts and letters at the University of Pennsylvania, to help authenticate the waltz. “Extensive research points to the strong likelihood that the piece is by Chopin,” according to the statement. This research included analysis by paper conservators who found that the paper and ink match those that Chopin normally used. The Morgan Library & Museum believes that the fact that the manuscript is so small could mean that it was meant to be a gift that the recipient would have kept in an autograph album. Chopin was known to sign manuscripts that were gifts, but this one is unsigned, which the museum says suggests that he ultimately decided against giving it away. “This newly discovered waltz expands our understanding of Chopin as a composer and opens new questions for scholars to consider regarding when he wrote it and for whom it was intended,” said McClellan in the statement. “To hear this work for the first time will be an exciting moment for everyone in the world of classical piano.” “Our extensive music collection is defined by handwritten examples of the creative process and it is thrilling to have uncovered a new and unknown work by such a renowned composer,” said Colin B. Bailey, museum director, in the statement. The discovery of an unknown piece of work by Chopin has not happened since the late 1930s, according to the museum. The Polish composer was born in 1810 and was best known for solo piano pieces. Chopin died in Paris, France, at the age of just 39. He’s one of Poland’s most famous sons, and his name adorns the airport serving the capital Warsaw, as well as parks, streets, benches and buildings. His works and image are ubiquitous across the central European country, and his residences bear unmissable plaques. Busts and statues of his likeness are dotted across several major cities. Even his heart, preserved in alcohol after his death in 1849 is sealed into a wall of Warsaw’s Holy Cross Church. But recent suggestions about Chopin’s private life collided awkwardly with Poland’s staunchly conservative traditions – and caused some to question whether the story of Chopin that Poles are told from a young age is true. According to a Swiss radio documentary released in 2020, the composer had relationships with men, and those relationships were left out of history by successive historians and biographers; a potentially thorny charge in one of Europe’s worst countries for LGBTQ rights.",Not Found

38,Influencers are playing a big role in this year’s election. There’s no way to tell who’s getting paid for their endorsements,"“There are only 22 days more to vote, so like seriously go vote … it’s so important to me that we mobilize our community toPokémon Goto the polls,” influencer Mikey Angelo, who’s known online for his comedic rap videos, said in a recent Instagram video. Angelo was paid by a Democratic political action committee for the post, a fact that’s clearly noted in the caption. But he didn’t legally have to disclose the relationship. Partnerships with influencers have become an increasingly popular campaign strategy. But a regulatory gap means that unlike political ads that run on TV — or typical sponsored content that influencers post for brands — content creators are not required to disclose if they’ve been paid to endorse a candidate or speak about a political issue on their page. A campaign can post a video on its own platforms and then pay an influencer to promote it, or pay an individual to create his or her own promotional material for a candidate, without the campaign or influencer having to disclose anything, the Federal Election Commission determined earlier this year. That means users are often left to try to judge for themselves which posts are paid endorsements versus creators’ genuine, freely shared expressions of support when they’re mixed together in feeds — along with the regular collection of normal posts and non-political #sponcon — sometimes, with no indication of which is which. And that could further complicate an already muddy information ecosystem, at a time whennearly 40% of young Americanssay they regularly get their news from TikTok and when US adults under 30 arenearly as likelyto trust information from social media as from national news outlets, according to the Pew Research Center. In 2024, political content posted by social media creators has become just as important as traditional celebrity endorsements — if not more. Influencers often have huge, engaged followings who trust them because they bring a sense of authenticity that traditional celebrities, like actors and entertainers, lack. And politicians want to take advantage of that. If influencers’ vast followings already take their advice on everything from dietary supplements to parenting, politics could be added to the mix, too. “Influencers might not seem as professionally curated as trained actors and actresses,” said Krysten Stein, an assistant professor of communication at the University of Cincinnati Blue Ash College. “We tend to trust people who are more real or more like us,” she said. “And then if they endorse a candidate, well, ‘Hey, they’re kind of like me. We have similar interests or are from a similar place.’ So, sure, I might trust them more.” In July, between posts about vacations, his nascent boxing career and his body wash brand, influencer Jake Paulposted an Instagram videoshowing him play-fighting with former President Donald Trump. “We need Trump to knockout all his opponents on Election Day,” Paul said in the caption of the video, which racked up more than 1.5 million likes. Last month, Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walzappeared in a YouTube videogoing for a walk with his dog, Scout, and Matt Nelson, the human behind the popular channel We Rate Dogs. The video, which served as a sort of get-to-know-you opportunity for Walz, gained more than 600,000 views on YouTube; a clipposted to Xwas viewed more than 1.5 million times. (A representative for Nelson said he was not paid for the video; Paul also was not compensated for his appearance with Trump, according to a person familiar with his business.) This year’s Democratic National Convention also provided media credentials tomore than 200 influencers, along with acushy “creator lounge”from which to post content about Vice President Kamala Harris’ White House bid. Angelo’s post is part of a$2.7 million digital campaignfrom Democratic political action committee Priorities USA, which has contributed to election efforts for Harris, and voter engagement PAC Somos Votantes. Together, the two organizations paid 15 social media creators to produce content encouraging Latinos to vote. (Angelo did not respond to a request for comment.) “It’s no surprise that in a political environment, when our No. 1 job is to have our message resonate and break through and be trusted, that working with content creators who already have trust built up with their followers just makes a lot of sense,” said Danielle Butterfield, executive director of Priorities USA, which has also run influencer campaigns around local elections and progressive issues like reproductive rights. Priorities typically works with influencer marketing agencies to determine how much to pay a creator, Butterfield told CNN. But the organization leaves partnership and payment disclosures up to the creators themselves. “We’re working with a lot of folks who haven’t done political work before, so there’s often a little bit of confusion around, ‘Oh, I don’t have to disclose? That’s not the law?’ So we often have to explain that [there is no disclosure law,],” Butterfield said. “We walk the creators through what the rules are and then we leave it up to them to determine how they want to post their content.” In the second half of 2020, Trump’s then-reelection campaign paid nearly $1.8 million to an influencer marketing business, Axiosreportedin early 2021, citing Federal Election Commission filings. Also on the right, conservative group Turning Point USA has a yearslong history oftraining and promoting influencers— its website touts partnerships with the likes of right-wing activistJack PosobiecandRiley Gaines, the former NCAA swimmer who has opposed including transgender athletes in women’s sports — to spread its message. And Tana Mongeau, a YouTuber with more than 5 million subscribers, suggested during anepisodeof her podcast last month that she was offered “millions” to endorse an unnamed political party on social media. Mongeau had already publicly backed Harris, implying that the offer came from elsewhere. Mongeau spoke in vague terms about the endorsement offer, but indicated that she’d turned down the money. “I was being allegedly told and alleged list of other influencers that have already, hypothetically, accepted money to do those hypothetical things,” Mongeau said. (Spokespeople for Mongeau didn’t respond to CNN’s requests for an interview.) The Harris campaign declined to comment for this piece. The Trump campaign, as well as the Democratic National Committee and Republican National Committee, did not respond to requests for comment. The Federal Trade Commission in 2019 laid out new guidelines for social media influencers,requiring themto clearly label posts for which they’d been paid to promote a product or company, by adding a disclosure such as #ad or #sponsored in the caption. But by law, the FTC’s rules can cover content related only to “commerce,” said spokesperson Mitchell Katz, citingagency guidance. Election advertisements are overseen by a different agency, the Federal Elections Commission, which lacks a similar disclosure rule for individuals who are paid to make endorsements on social media. The FEC does havestrict transparency rulesaround paid political communications over the phone, on TV or on physical mailers — everyone is familiar with those “paid for by” disclosures — but those requirements don’t apply to influencers. The FEC had the opportunity last year to extend its rules to influencers, but chose not to, saying that campaign payments to individuals fell outside the scope ofa broader package of regulationsfor ads involving payments to a “website, digital device, application, or advertising platform.” The commission determined that campaign payments to creators to produce political messaging are not “public communications” that would require disclosure. Despite voting for the overall package, two FEC commissionersdissentedover the decision on influencers, saying the agency “missed a golden opportunity” to issue clear guidance on a growing means of political communication. “The public is entitled to know when those influencers are being paid to spread a political message,” wrote Commissioners Ellen Weintraub and Shana Broussard, who were appointed by former Presidents George W. Bush and Trump, respectively. In the absence of federal regulations, some platforms have instituted their own rules, although enforcing them may be tricky if creators aren’t up-front about their relationships with political groups. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, has since 2020 allowed paid political content from influencers, so long as the organization paying for it is registered in itsad library. TikTok says itdoes not allowany political advertising, even from creators. TikTok removed one video that was labeled as part of the Priorities USA and Somos Votantes campaign after CNN flagged it to the platform. Critics say that if individuals were required to disclose paid political posts, it could have unintended consequences for political speech — especially when any payments to influencers should already be reflected in the campaigns’ own routine expenditure reports. The FEC should take steps to make it easier for the public to access this information before cracking down on creators, said Ari Cohn, a First Amendment law expert at the think tank and advocacy group TechFreedom. “I don’t want to live in a world where to be able to post things about politics online, I have to consult a lawyer first,” Cohn said, adding that although the FEC says the current rules don’t apply to influencers, a future FEC could easily come to the opposite interpretation. While politicians can and should try to reach voters where they are, the advent of new technologies doesn’t change campaigns’ underlying obligation to behave ethically on those platforms, said Robert Weissman, co-president of Public Citizen, an accountability non-profit. “It makes all the sense in the world for campaigns to pitch themselves to influencers and ask them to carry forward their message,” Weissman said. “If it’s a financial transaction, though, it’s vital that the money flow be disclosed, that people know the influencers are taking action because they’ve been paid, not just out of belief.” To be sure, not every creator is quietly earning money for weighing in on the election. There are likely plenty of cases where creators aren’t being paid for posting but are just “already really engaged” in the political conversation, said Cate Domino, a senior vice president for digital at Precision Strategies, a Democratic consulting firm. Campaigns may know “which messages are super important, but they’re having trouble getting to resonate with the right audiences,” so they partner with politically engaged creators to “help us get this message out,” said Domino, who added that her firm does not work directly with the Harris campaign. “There is something in it for the creator too, right?” she said. “If the campaign is lifting up their content, that’s them reaching a whole host of people who — especially if you’re a creator who’s known for your advocacy work — probably like really align with the content that you’re putting out.”",Global

40,German-Iranian national and longtime US resident executed in Iran,"A German-Iranian national and longtime US resident has been executed in Iran after being convicted of terrorism offences, according to Iranian state media citing the country’s judiciary-affiliated Mizan news agency. Jamshid Sharmahd, 69, was executed Monday morning for “planning and orchestrating a series of terrorist acts,” state-run IRNA and Press TV reported. His execution sparked condemnation from the United States and Germany. Sharmahd’s daughter Gazelle has repeatedly said her father is innocent and that he faced a sham trial due to his political activism and criticism of the Islamic Republic. In a post on Instagram Monday, she accused the German and US government of failing her father, and described his reported death as “apparently retaliation (for) Israeli strikes on the regime.” Israel struck Iran multiple times on Saturday in an escalating regional tit-for-tat. Sharmahd was arrested in 2020 by Iranian authorities who claimed he headed a group accused of a deadly 2008 bombing in the city of Shiraz, according to state-run news agencies ISNA and IRNA. He was sentenced to death in 2022 for “corruption on Earth”, sparking widespread condemnation from human rights groups and Western governments. “He has been sentenced to death after a legal proceeding that has been widely criticized as a sham trial,” Vedant Patel, the US State Department’s principal deputy spokesperson said in a briefing last fall. Amnesty International also described the trial as “grossly unfair.” Following the news of his execution, German foreign minister Annalena Baerbock said that Sharmahd’s “murder” showed Tehran to be an “inhumane regime” that “uses death as a weapon.” Baerbock said the execution would have “serious consequences.” The United States’ Office of the Special Envoy for Iran said it was looking into reports of Sharmahd’s execution and said his killing would “represent the latest abhorrent act in the regime’s long history of transnational repression and accelerating rate of executions.” Sharmahd’s “kidnapping and rendition, as well as sham trial and reports of torture, were reprehensible,” the envoy’s office added. Abram Paley, the US Deputy Special Envoy, last year met with Sharmahd’s family to discuss his imprisonment and death sentence.",Global
41,"Japan’s iconic Mount Fuji has yet to see snow this winter, breaking a 130-year record","November is just a few days away, but Japan’s iconic Mount Fuji remains snowless, marking the latest date without a snowcap since records began 130 years ago. The peaks of Japan’s highest mountain are usually dusted in snow by early October, but as of Tuesday the summit has remained bare – raising the alarm of the impacts of the climate crisis on one of the country’s most beloved landmarks. The first snowfall signals the arrival of winter. It followsthe summer climbing season, which this year ended on September 10. Snowcaps begin to form on average on Fuji on October 2, and last year, it was recorded on October 5, according to Japan’s weather agency – though public broadcaster NHK reported that most of it melted away in early November due to warm temperatures. Japan’s Kofu Local Meteorological Office, which has announced the first snowfall on Fuji each year since it was established in 1894, has yet to do so this year, citing unseasonably warm weather. “Because of the fact that high temperatures in Japan have been continuing since the summer and as it has been raining, there has been no snowfall,” Shinichi Yanagi, a meteorological officer at the Kofu office, told CNN Tuesday. The lack of snow as of October 29, beats the previous record of October 26, set in 1955 and 2016, he said. Japan recorded its hottest summer on record this year since statistics began in 1898, the Meteorological Agency said in September. The average temperature from June to August was 1.76 degrees Celsius above the normal level, surpassing the previous record of 1.08 degrees set in 2010, the agency said. Japan remained unusually warm into fall, with at least 74 cities recording temperatures of 30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit) or higher in the first week of October,accordingto analysis from the non-profit research group Climate Central. The unusual October heat Japan experienced was made three times more likely because of the climate crisis, Climate Central found. Japan’s extreme summer heat was not a local event. This summer broke global heat records for a second straight year, with 2024 firmly on track to be thehottest year in recorded history. The natural climate pattern El Niño helped drive the spike in temperatures, as well as human-caused factors such as burning fossil fuels — the main driver of the climate crisis. Scientists have long-warned that theworld needs to limit global warmingto 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels to stave off the most catastrophic impacts of climate change. Anew studyin January found that theclimate crisishas reduced snowpack in most parts of the Northern Hemisphere in the last 40 years. Later snowfall on Mount Fuji could be a worrying indication of where the world is headed, withwarmer wintershaving an impacton snow, tourism, local economies, food and water supplies and even allergies. Straddling Japan’s Yamanashi and Shizuoka prefectures, the 3,776-meter Mount Fuji is a UNESCO World Heritage site and an icon of Japan. It’s usually coated in snow for most of the year until the annual climbing season opens in July, welcoming millions of visitors eager to hike to the summit or watch the sunrise from its famed slopes. In recent years, the mountain hassuffered from overtourism, and Japanese officials previously told CNN that visitors were littering, overtaxing toilet facilities and hiking in improper gear, which resulted in accidents or injuries. In July,authorities implementeda tourist tax and put new regulations in place to manage the crowds. Now, climbers must pay 2,000 yen ($12.40) per person, with a daily maximum of 4,000 climbers per day.",Global
42,Dwyane Wade’s new statue has people talking. Here’s a look at six other sports statues that went viral,"Receiving a statue of oneself is one of the biggest honors in sports. The ultimate testament to your career and physical proof of your legacy. However, molding a sporting superstar into metal obviously comes with its challenges. Sometimes, a statue may not always bear a total resemblance to its muse. The Miami Heat revealed a statue of franchise legend and basketball Hall of FamerDwyane Wadeon Sunday, with the design of the statue immediately going viral anddrawing some unwanted comparisons. “That’s crazy. I can’t believe that. Who is that guy?” Wadesaidat the unveiling. Whether Wade was expressing his shock at the sculpture’s design or simply coming to terms with the significance of the moment is up for debate, but he certainly isn’t the only sports star to have a statue draw attention for the wrong reasons. Legendary footballer Cristiano Ronaldo received the honor of having an airport in Madeira, Portugal – his place of birth – named after him, though he might have wished that the tributes stopped there. Instead, he was presented witharguably the most infamous statue of a sports legend ever. A bust of the then-Real Madrid star was unveiled at the airport, sending social media into a frenzy over its perceived likeness – or lack thereof – to its subject. Some suggested that the bust resembled former Republic of Ireland striker Niall Quinn or former Liverpool defender John Arne Riise. Despite the backlash, the bust’s artist, Emmanuel Santos, defended the design. “Even Jesus did not please everyone,” Santos told Portuguese websiteGlobo Sports. “This is a matter of taste, it’s not as simple as it seems. “What matters is the impact that this work generates. There is always the possibility of making a difference. I used photos of Cristiano Ronaldo and I searched the internet as a base. I put the photos next to me and started working on the bust. “Cristiano saw the photos that his brother sent him. I was with the brother at Cristiano’s museum in Madeira and from the messages he sent, I could tell that he liked what he saw.” In 2009, a statue of baseball Hall of Famer Walter Johnson was unveiled outside Nationals Park, the home of the Washington Nationals. Johnson forged a legendary career as a pitcher for the Washington Senators (who eventually relocated to become the Minnesota Twins) between 1907 and 1927. The statue’s design – which depicts Johnson in various stages of pitching motion – is certainly unique. However, Johnson’s grandson and biographer, Henry Thomas, used different words to describe it. “It just doesn’t work,”he said. “Those big pieces of matter coming out of Walter’s shoulder look like driftwood. But I don’t like any part of the statue. I really object to it. It’s ridiculous, not even close. He looks awkward. His delivery point is all wrong. His legs are too stiff. The ’W’ on his uniform is too big. And the inscription is on the back (of the base). It doesn’t even face the plaza.” While most tennis tournaments like to stick to trophies for their winners, the Shanghai Masters likes to do things differently for its men’s singles winners. While the champion does get to take home some silverware, they also receive the distinction of seeing their likeness transformed into a terracotta statue. Designed in the style of China’s famous Terracotta Army, the champion is depicted holding a tennis racket, rather than a weapon. Great Britain’s Andy Murray won the competition in 2010 and was honored in terracotta form the following year – with the inspiration for the design presumably coming pre-haircut. Perhaps the statue was a good omen for the Scotsman, who went on to defend his title in 2011 before winning it again in 2016. Soccer icon Diego Maradona was honored with a striking statue bearing a golden left footby former club Napoliin 2022 on what would have been his 62nd birthday – Maradona died in 2020. The Argentinean is synonymous with the Italian club, so it might come as surprise to some that he was also enshrined in statue form in Kolkata, India. According to Sky Sports, the statue is 12 feet tall, with Maradona himself helping to unveil it at a charity event in 2017. He is shown hoisting the World Cup trophy. “Good to see the chap that did the Ronaldo one is still in business,”one social media user remarkedafter the statue was unveiled. Questionable statues of soccer superstars seem to be somewhat of a theme. A statue of Liverpool forwardMohamed Salahwas unveiled in his native Egypt in 2018 that showed him with his arms outstretched in his trademark celebration. The peculiar proportions of the sculpture drew attention, with the figure featuring an oversized head and unusually short and skinny legs. Even the artist, Mai Abdel Allah, was not totally satisfied with the outcome. “Bronze did not do it justice and I had no hand in pouring (the mold) in bronze because bronze can only be poured in specific places in Egypt and sculptors cannot do it on their own,” she told Egypt’s state-run Al-Ahram online. “I welcome all criticisms this statue received; this is natural because an artist is subjected to a number of tastes but I am personally not happy with the statue’s final product.” David Beckham’s celebrity status transcended soccer a long time ago, so it isn’t exactly a surprise to see his likeness used in advertising campaign. That didn’t make it any less surreal when a silver statue of the Englishman appeared in New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco in 2012, depicting Beckham in underwear rather than a soccer uniform. The sculpture was part of H&M underwear marketing scheme and occurred while Beckham was under contract with Major League Soccer club Los Angeles Galaxy.",Not Found
43,"Halloween partygoers pushed boundaries in Shanghai last year. This year, police are taking notice","A year afterShanghai’s boisterous Halloween celebrationsmade global headlines, revelers dressed as Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and comic book superheroes were escorted away by police as authorities appeared to crack down on the festivities. Videos on social media showed a heavy police presence in three busy Shanghai bar and restaurant areas, where partygoers typically celebrate the annual tradition more closely associated with the United States, raising concerns about further narrowing of personal freedoms inChina. Crowd control fences had been erected to restrict pedestrian traffic in some streets, according to images on social media, and a park near another popular nightlife area where costumed partygoers had congregated on Saturday was also shuttered the next day. The tight controls in China’s most cosmopolitan city follow last year’s at timesraucous celebrations, when young people came out in force to celebrate the first Halloween since the lifting of China’sstringent Covid-19 restrictions. Manydonned costumes offering social critique – a rare phenomenon in a country where dissent is not tolerated in any form. This year, Chinese police have appeared keen to avoid similar scenes – with multiple videos circulating online, geolocated by CNN, showing police stopping people in various Halloween costumes and escorting some away. It was not clear whether they were detained or merely escorted from the immediate area. The circumstances leading up to these interactions with law enforcement were also not clear.As of Tuesday, some videos were still circulating China’s heavily censored internet, while others seemed to have been taken down. While some officially sanctioned Halloween celebrations, such as those at Shanghai Disney Resort and the Happy Valley amusement park, went ahead as scheduled, the apparent tamp-down on some publicHalloween gatherings this year caught the attention of Chinese social media users, with one user on Weibo, China’s equivalent of X, noting that her social media feed felt particularly empty. “Was dressing up for Halloween no longer allowed at Julu Road in Shanghai this year? How come there hasn’t been a single photo in my feed?” she asked, referring to a popular nightlife area. Online images geolocated by CNN showed policeat one point restricted pedestrian flow on Julu Road. Like other places in Asia, such as Japan and South Korea, many young people in China treat Halloween as an occasion to dress up and meet their friends in venues that put on themed events. But Chinese state media have warnedin recent yearsagainst citizens being “overly passionate” about Western festivals – part of abroader, nationalistic backlashagainst perceived foreign influence. Lastweekend’s celebrations appeared to end early for one young man who donned a blond wig and a bandage on his right ear to imitate former US President Donald Trump, a now-deleted post on Chinese social media platform Douyin showed. Trump wore the bandage after a bullet skimmed his ear during an assassination attemptin July. Superheroes Spiderman and Batman, as well as a man who donneda yellow robe with a beaded necklace in the image of the Buddha, were all escorted away by police, according to online videos. CNN attempted to reach Shanghai authorities for comment on the number of interactions with revelers lastweekend, but has not received a response. An officer at a local police station said they weren’t authorized to speak to the media. In China, crowd control measures are not unusual in public, especially during holidays, but some online users openly wondered what it would mean for future Halloweens. “(I guess) there will never be any Halloween celebration in Shanghai as innovative as the one in 2023. It will slowly lose its edginess and become harmonized,” auser wrote. Celebrations last year in Shanghai were marked by huge crowds and revelers using the holiday to take tongue-in-cheek swipes at China’s strict Covid lockdowns and lackluster economy. Some dressed as university graduates who had failed to land a job, a reference to China’s sluggish economy and high youth unemployment rates. Others rocked up in hazmat suits in a sarcastic swipe at China’s stringent Covid control measures, which sawShanghai locked downfor roughly two months and sparkedrare protests. That rare public critique in a country of heavy censorship both in online debate, media and entertainment was largely unimpeded by police last year, who practiced crowd control but did not appear to be proactively stopping people in costumes, based on media reports. The Shanghai municipal government even praised last year’s Halloween celebration as “a sign of cultural tolerance.” “The recent Halloween celebration in Shanghai, with its unique blend of western traditions and Chinese creativity, offered a glimpse into the evolving cultural landscape of a vibrant city,” it said in a statement last year. Alfred Wu, an associate professor at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy at the National University of Singapore, said last year’s celebration happened during “a vacuum” when the Shanghai authorities were working to return to normal less than a year after the lifting of Covid lockdowns. “This year authorities are much more prepared, and they do not agree with these kinds of activities,” he said.",Global
44,Chris Brown’s history of violence revisited in new documentary,"Chris Brown’shistory of violenceis back in the spotlight with a new documentary focusing on years-old accusations against the singer, including his 2009 assault of Rihanna. The documentary also highlights a rape claim from a woman who previously sued Brown for allegedly drugging and assaulting her in 2020, during what she described as a yacht party hosted by Sean “Diddy” Combs. The documentary — “Chris Brown: A History of Violence,” which aired Sunday night on Investigation Discovery — marked the first time this Jane Doe has sat down for an interview to discuss her allegations. (CNN and Investigation Discovery share a parent company.) The woman initially brought forth her allegations in a $20 million lawsuit in 2022, which was dismissed by a judge that same year, citing lack of prosecution. The Miami Beach Police concluded that the report was unfounded and that no probable cause existed to arrest Brown on criminal charges, according to the documentary, which stated that the case was closed. The accuser, who appears in silhouette in the documentary to shield her identity, explains in her televised interview that she is speaking out to “shed light on what really happened.” “Unless people start speaking up and people actually stop victim blaming the people that do speak up, then that’s the only way he can be stopped,” Doe said. Doe states in the documentary that in December 2020, she was invited by a friend to a New Years party hosted by Combs on a yacht, where she claims she was drugged and raped by Brown. Levi McCathern, an attorney for Brown, did not respond to CNN’s requests for comment. McCathern told Investigation Discovery that Doe’s claims are “entirely fabricated” and called the documentary “malicious and false.” Combs was not named as a defendant in Doe’s lawsuit and no allegations are made against him in the documentary. He is currently detained in federal custody while awaiting trial on criminal sex trafficking and racketeering charges. Combs has pleaded not guilty. Representatives for Combs did not respond to CNN’s request for comment. “I see Diddy. He welcomes us, he’s really nice,” Doe recalled of her arrival at the party in the documentary. Doe said Brown greeted her and she was excited to meet the star to discuss her career aspirations as a dancer. Brown handed Doe a drink, which she consumed, she said in the documentary. “I did start to feel like just kind of tired and my body was just feeling like a little heavy or whatever. And he was just like, ‘Yeah, it’s kind of loud out here. Do you want to go towards the back?’” Doe recalled. She said Brown then directed her to a bedroom on the vessel, where Doe said she felt increasingly incapacitated and unable to move before he allegedly assaulted her. Brown later put his number in Doe’s phone. Doe alleges that he texted to ask her to take a Plan B emergency contraception pill, which she did. Speaking today, Doe said she was “disgusted” at the time, but did not have the tools to process what had happened to her. “My brain was just like really trying to rationalize what just happened,” she said. “I didn’t want anyone to know. I was just so embarrassed.” In therapy, Doe said she realized that she had been sexually assaulted. “Chris Brown raped me. And I can say that, and I know it for a fact instead of telling myself that it wasn’t,” Doe said in the documentary. “It was rape.” According to the documentary, Brown’s lawyers submitted text messages to the Miami Beach police that showed Doe remained in touch with the singer and sent him sexual messages. Doe acknowledged their continued communication, explaining in the documentary that since she was initially in denial about the alleged assault, she continued to speak to him. “I was actually really hurt, so I was still trying to salvage what could happen….Maybe I just do need to get more clarity, and that’s why I still did continue to talk to him,” Doe said in the film. The documentary features domestic violence experts who explain typical behaviors of sexual assault victims, including remaining in contact after an assault or trying to rationalize an assault to help get rid of fear and shame. The experts discussed power imbalances between high-profile alleged perpetrators and accusers. “I wish it didn’t happen. I wish I could go back and never go back on that yacht and just be a normal girl and not have to go through all of this, but I did,” Doe said in the documentary. When Brown burst onto the music scene in 2005 at the age of 16, his talent was touted as “the new Michael Jackson.” Despite numerous legal run-ins in the years since, the musician has continued with a successful career. Brown’s legal troublesbegan in 2009, when Los Angeles police responded to a 911 call that a woman was assaulted on a Hollywood street just after midnight on February 8. They found Brown’s then-girlfriend Rihanna, who was 20 at the time, with a badly bruised face. Brown, then 19, turned himself into police hours before he and Rihanna were to perform at the Grammys. He publicly apologized a week after his arrest, and was formally charged with felony counts of assault and making criminal threats the following month. He agreed to a plea deal that included five years’ probation, 1,400 hours of “labor-oriented service” and a counseling program. “Chris Brown is an amazing and talented musician, but let’s call a thing a thing: I think he’s an abuser of women — consistently, unapologetically,” Sergeant Cheryl Dorsey, a 20-year veteran of the Los Angeles Police Department, said in the documentary. A representative for Rihanna did not respond to CNN’s request for comment regarding her assault being revisited in the project. Three years after he attacked Rihanna, a woman filed a police report against Brown, accusing him of grabbing her iPhone after she used it to take a photo of the singer in a car on a Miami street in February 2012. The report prompted a police investigation that could have threatened Brown’s probation, but no charge was ever filed. The following year, a different woman accused Brown of assaulting her at an Anaheim, California, nightclub in June 2013. Brown’s rep told CNN the accusation was “totally false and unfounded.” Anaheim police investigated, but did not file charges against Brown. In July 2013,Brown’s probation was revokedafter he was accused of hit-and-run driving and driving without a license. A woman told investigators Brown “went ballistic” after a traffic accident and screamed at her. The charges were dropped after Brown reached a “civil compromise” with his accuser a month later. Brown’s probation was reinstated afterwards. In October of that year,Brown and a bodyguard were accused of assaulting a manon a Washington, DC sidewalk. The man said Brown punched him in the face, the police report said. Brown was released from jail the next day. Brown entered a Malibu, California, rehab facility at the end of that month, but was ordered to return to rehab in November after it was revealed he hadacted violentlyduring his first rehab stint, resulting in his dismissal.Brown stayed in the second rehab program throughoutmuch of his trial for the DC assault, but was taken into custody again in March 2014 for allegedlyviolating various rehab rules. In May 2014, Brownappeared in courtfor a probation violation hearing, where he admitted to violating his probation and was ordered by a judge to serve one year in jail. In September of that year, hepleaded guilty to simple assaultin the case stemming from the Washington sidewalk skirmish. He was sentenced to time served and had to pay a $150 fine. In August 2016, Los Angeles police swarmed Brown’s home after a woman accused him of pulling a gun on her there.Brown was arrested on suspicion of assault with a deadly weapon and released on $250,000 bail.He denied the allegations at the time and no charges were ever filed, according toPeople. Brown’s ex-girlfriend, “Claws” actress Karrueche Tran, obtained a five-year restraining order against him in 2017, alleging he had threatened her with violence. While attorneys for Brown contested the petition, he did not comment on it at the time,according media reports. Investigation Discovery’s documentary coincides with National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. It is produced with the global domestic violence initiative, No More, and is airing as part of the network’s “No Excuse for Abuse” campaign and commitment to domestic violence survivors. The documentary’s release, coming on the backdrop of criminal charges against Combs and raising questions about societal views towards domestic violence victims, could generate a conversation — yet again — surrounding Brown’s past.",Miami Beach
45,"More than 1 in 3 tree species are at risk of going extinct, new analysis shows","The world’s trees are in critical danger, with a staggering number of tree species teetering on the brink of extinction, according to a new global analysis released Monday. The decade-long project found that more than one in three tree species are threatened with extinction, underscoring the scale of the crisis facing our planet’s ecosystems. The report for the International Union for Conservation of Nature’sRed List, which dropped during the two-week UN biodiversity conference in Cali, Colombia, revealed that of the 47,282 tree species assessed, at least 16,425 are at risk of going extinct — more than double the number of all birds, mammals, reptiles and amphibians threatened with extinction combined. Planet-warming fossil fuel pollution is threatening the trees, which suck that pollution out of the atmosphere, meaning their loss is exacerbating the climate crisis. Some of the major threats trees face also include deforestation for urban development, agriculture, invasive species, diseases, as well as sea level rise and more intense storms, researchers say. The list reveals how “the loss of trees directly threatens thousands of other species, plants, fungi and animals, demonstrating how deeply interconnected our natural world is,” Grethel Aguilar, IUCN Director General, said during a Monday press briefing in Colombia. “Trees are the barometer of life,” Aguilar added. They produce the oxygen humans breathe, provide food and shelter for wildlife, give medicine and sustenance to Indigenous peoples, and absorb heat-trapping carbon pollution from the atmosphere. The highest portion of threatened trees is found on islands like Fiji, Cuba and Madagascar. In South America, which is home to the Amazon Rainforest, 3,356 out of the 13,668 assessed tree species are at risk of extinction due to deforestation for crop farming and livestock ranching. The Red List is considered the most comprehensive global source for threatened species and extinction information. The index categorizes species by those that are of least concern, near threatened, vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered and extinct. These classifications are based on the species’ population size, distribution, habitat loss, and other threats such as the climate crisis. Being listed as a threatened species means that the species faces the risk of extinction, sending a serious warning sign that calls on governments and organizations to take urgent conservation efforts to prevent a species’ extinction. Those efforts need to start with trees, Aguilar said. “Can you imagine a planet without trees?” she added. “We, humans, are capable to reverse this and save these trees that we depend on, so the task that we have is huge.”",Global

47,US approves $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan including advanced missile defense system,"The United States has approved $2 billion in arms sales toTaiwan, including the first-time delivery to the self-ruled island of an advanced surface-to-air missile defense system, in a move that has drawn China’s criticism. Taiwan’s presidential office on Saturday thanked Washington for greenlighting the potential arms sales. Under the island’s new president, Lai Ching-te, Taiwan has been stepping up defense measures as China increased its military threats against the territory it claims as its own. Beijing last week heldwar games encircling Taiwanfor the second time since Lai took office in May. The US is Taiwan’s strongest unofficial ally and its laws bound it to provide Taiwan with the means to defend itself. “Strengthening Taiwan’s self-defense capabilities is the foundation for maintaining regional stability,” Taiwan’s presidential spokesperson Karen Kuo said. China criticized the move, saying it undermined its sovereignty and security interests, was harming US-China relations and threatened peace across the Taiwan Strait, which separates China from Taiwan. “China strongly condemns and firmly opposes this and has lodged serious protests with the US,” read a statement by a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson. “We will take resolute countermeasures and take all measures necessary to firmly defend national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity.” The potential sales package includes three National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS) and related equipment valued at up to $1.16 billion, according to the US State Department’s Bureau of Political-Military Affairs. It also includes radar systems worth an estimated $828 million. The NASAMS system has been battle-tested in Ukraine and will help to strengthen the Taiwanese army’s air defense capabilities, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said. China’s war games last week were aimed at practicing the “sealing off of key ports and key areas” around Taiwan, according to Chinese officials. Taiwan counted a record one-day total of 153 aircraft, 14 navy vessels and 12 Chinese government ships.",Global
48,‘A disability is not inability’: How this blind soccer league is changing lives in the world’s newest country,"South Sudanis not known for its soccer presence. The world’s youngest nation is typically associated with basketball, with several current and former NBA players having roots in the country and theBright Starsinternational squad making its Olympic debut earlier this year. But one grassroots competition is beginning to make waves in the country with a different version of the Beautiful Game and is shining a much-needed light on disabilities in the nation. South Sudan’s Blind Premier League is backed byLight for the World, a non-governmental organization that works for disability rights and inclusion in South Sudan, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Kenya, Mozambique and Uganda. It focuses on eye health and works with “under-served communities,” helping people with disabilities facing multiple barriers, such as children, women, rural communities and those hit by disaster. The pioneering league began holding matches in 2023 and is currently made up four teams, all based in the nation’s capital city of Juba. The majority of the players are in their 20s, though the youngest player is 15. For those involved with the league, it provides an opportunity that many thought that they would never have. Jimmy Just Augustin, who captains the competition’s Kator Blind Football Club, had never even heard ofblind soccerbefore he was introduced to it. Augustin went blind as a child in 2012. He experienced pain in both of his eyes, but was told by a village doctor that nothing was wrong. He eventually visited a doctor in Juba, but by that point, his retinas were damaged beyond repair. He was forced to give up soccer but discovered the blind format in 2020. He has been nicknamed “Messi” –after the Argentinean soccer legend– by his teammates as a result of his dazzling dribbling ability. “I’m very happy with this experience, because I never thought that I would play football again … I was thinking that I can never play any kind of sport again,” he said, speaking toCNN Sport. “With disability, you can think, ‘I’m nothing, I don’t have something to do now, I’m useless.’ But currently, the activity is there, the (opportunity) to dribble the ball is there. “I’ve got new friends, and this experience that I’ve got from blind football makes me very happy.” Away from the pitch, Augustin is a first-year student at the University of Juba and advocates for disability inclusion in schools. He told CNN about what it means to him to set an example for other people with disabilities in South Sudan. “A disability is not inability. If you are not seeing, it’s not that you are useless or not able to do something,” he said, adding that he tells visually impaired people: “If you want to change your life, come and join blind football.” The rules of blind soccer differ significantly from its able-bodied counterpart. Each team is made up of five players: four outfield players and a goalkeeper. The outfield players must be classified as “completely blind” – meaning they have “very low visual acuity and/or no light perception” – but all of them must wear eye patching and eyeshades as some might see more light and shadows than others. The goalkeepers, meanwhile, are sighted or partially sighted and provide vital communication to their team in defense, though they must stay inside the small, restricted area around the goal. The ball has sewn-in rattles, making noise while it is on the move. Soccer games are notorious for their raucous crowds, but blind soccer spectators are required to remain silent during the game, so players are able to hear and locate the ball, which is a size three, smaller than the standard size five ball used in the 11-a-side, able-bodied game. Matches are 40 minutes long (played in two 20-minute halves) and take place on 40m x 20m (or roughly 131.2ft x 65.6ft) fields which have walls all the way around to prevent the ball from going out of play, allowing for a faster paced game. Players must shout “voy” or “I’m going” in Spanish – in a nod to the game’s Iberian roots – when making a tackle to warn opponents and minimize injuries. Each team also has another two guides to help them, one at the halfway line and another behind the goal the team is attacking. The International Blind Sports Association (IBSA) made blind soccer one of its official sports in 1996 and it has been a men’s Paralympic event since 2004. Host nation France made history at the 2024 Paralympics in Paris, winning its first gold medal in the sport by defeating Argentina on penalties in the final. Argentina ended the reign of Brazil in the semifinals, who had won gold at every Games since the event was introduced. TheSeleçãowere forced to settle for bronze, beating Colombia in the third-place game. After decades of civil war, South Sudan gained independence from Sudan in 2011 following a referendum, making it the world’s newest widely-recognized state. The nation descended into a civil war of its own shortly after, with the war officially ending in 2018 – though violence persists to this day.According to the United Nations (UN) Refugee Agency, the conflict produced the largest refugee crisis in Africa. It ranks second to last, only ahead of Somalia, on the UN’s Human Development Index. Nearly 2.4 million people had fled the country as refugees as of June 2023, while 2.3 million people are classed as internally displaced within South Sudan. Among them is Simon Madol, who lives at the Mahad camp for Internally Displaced People (IDP) in Juba. Madolsaidthat soccer was his “source of happiness and joy,” but he was forced to abandon it when civil war broke out in 2013. He explained to CNN that he came across inclusive sports when approached by Light for the World at the IDP camp. He now serves as both a coach and a technical director in the league and works with Light for the World as a Disability Inclusion Facilitator. According to Light for the World, it is estimated there are about 1.2 million people with disabilities in South Sudan. The countrysigned the UN’s disability rights conventionlast year in a historic step. Madol explained some of the challenges faced by disabled people in a nation facing so much internal struggle. “The main challenge is the attitude of the people, a negative attitude,” he said. “Even in the family level, the community level, the level of negative attitude is always there, and this negative attitude leads to discrimination.” Ignorance is at the root of the problem, according to Madol, and can dissuade people from getting involved in sports, such as blind soccer. There are also everyday issues experienced in the workplace. “Most of the institutions are not accessible … you can find that you want to go to the office, but because the doors are narrow – there are steps, no ramps – it becomes hard for you to go,” said Madol. “Even in the schools, these things are also here.” When it comes to blind soccer itself, the sport is not yet as accessible as it needs to be.Madol explained the specialized ball is not available to buy in the country – groups such as Light for the World have to provide the equipment – meaning that players are unable to practice anywhere other than at training. Matches are scheduled to be played every weekend, though it can be expensive to hire the pitches. Despite some shortcomings, the competition has quickly had a positive impact, with Augustin saying that it has helped to raise awareness about disabilities and combat negative attitudes in the country, while Madol says that it has given its members a new direction in life. “People are coming from far locations just to come and play this sport … Back in the day, they would only go from the house to school, from school to home,” he said. “But right now, there is another thing, blind football, where you find new people, new friends, communicate, make more connections, do other things outside – you support each other.” Though the league is only a year old and still in a relatively nascent stage, it is focused on expansion. Madol told CNN that the aim is to involve teams from every state in South Sudan and has spent time in different parts of the country to assess how blind soccer can be brought to the area. The league also has lofty international aspirations. According to Madol, organizers are currently in the process of registering with IBSA to create a pathway for South Sudan to compete at the Blind Football African Championship in 2026. Success at this tournament could potentially give the country a route into the World Blind Football Championships. “And through the World Cup of blind football, who knows? Maybe in 2028, at the upcoming Paralympics, we might participate,” said Madol. “And if we don’t participate, we would have already prepared a way, and straight away, the next generation will pick up from there.” He added that “dream” was no longer a suitable way to describe the league and players’ targets, and that the word “goal” is the more appropriate term. “It was a dream, but it’s now coming into reality because we are now working on it,” he said. The goal is shared by players like Augustin. “We want this football to not just be played here in South Sudan only … not in Africa only, but worldwide,” he said. “I want more players, more of these upcoming generations to come and join. Because leaders come, leaders go. Today, we are the founders. And tomorrow, the next generation will come and take over from us.”",Not Found
49,"Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are everywhere and could have many health impacts, researchers say","A class of chemicals –– likely in products all over many homes in the United States –– could be impacting your hormone health. The question is how worried should people be about these endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), such asphthalates,BPA or bisphenol A, and brominatedflame retardants? The scientific literature around EDCs is still growing, but associations have been suggested between exposure and health problems including brain development, fertility and puberty, said Dr. Michael Bloom, professor of global and community health at George Mason University College of Public Health in Fairfax, Virginia. And while there are still many questions researchers want to explore around EDCs, organizations like the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit that researches and advocates for safer products, are encouraging individuals to take steps to avoid exposure. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals affect hormones, which are chemicals that play the important role of carrying messages throughout your body to coordinate different functions in organs, skin, muscles and other tissues, accordingto the Cleveland Clinic. Here’s what experts have to say about EDCs and what you need to know about them. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are not produced by the human body but influence the way your hormones function, Bloom said. Hormones are essential to many biological processes in the body, such as puberty, reproduction and brain development. Some of these chemicals can mimic the hormones your body produces, such as estrogen or testosterone. Other EDCs impact hormonal synthesis so that the body makes more of a hormone, less of it, or changes how it breaks down, he added. Phthalates, for example, are synthetic chemicals that manufacturers often use in hundreds of products such as food and beverage containers and plastic wrap. These EDCs interfere with the production of testosterone, according to theEndocrine Society. Brominated flame retardants are used in electronics, clothing and furniture, and are associated with abnormal function of the thyroid, which has a key role in childhood development, the society said. “Endocrine-disruptingchemicals in some way affect hormonal communication,” Bloom said. “And hormonal communication is a critical pathway by which our brain communicates with tissues, and tissues communicate with one another, and everyday function that keeps us running, hopefully at high efficiency.” Chronic exposure toa substance that blocks or alters hormone activity can have serious consequences, added Alexa Friedman, a senior scientist on the healthy living team at the Environmental Working Group. “Anything that impacts your hormones is very likely to impact other health outcomes,” she said. The growingscientific literaturesuggests that endocrine disruptors could play a part in conditions including attention deficit disorder and impulse control disorders, Bloom added. “Hormones play a huge role in the development of the brain and the normal functioning of the brain, so being exposed to these EDCs early in life may change your development,” Friedman said. These chemicals may also be linked to thetrend of early puberty in girls, which “is associated with an increased risk of psychosocial problems, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and breast cancer,” said Dr. Natalie Shaw, head of the Pediatric Neuroendocrinology Group at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences. Studies have also shown concerns aroundinsulin sensitivity and diabetes,obesityandfertility, Bloom said. The problem with delving more deeply into investigative research is that it’s hard to study EDCs and their detrimental impacts on the human body, he added. Most of the evidence comes from using cell models, in which tissues or cells in a dish are exposed to high concentrations of the chemicals –– higher than most people would ever naturally come into contact with, Bloom said. To understand what a more “biologically realistic” level of exposure would do, researchers may look at urine samples for the presence of EDCs and compare the levels against different markers of health, he said. But the current scientific literature is controversial, Bloom said.Some studiessay yes, EDC exposure is a significant risk factor for poorer health outcomes, while otherreports contradictthat. “We’re in a position where it’s like, ‘is it better to be safe than sorry?’” he added. Researchers, regulatory bodies and individuals are wrestling with whether it’s worth it to make changes now in case the research does show it’s necessary to eliminate EDCs or wait to avoid the cost and effort that comes with replacing products for those who are lower risk for exposure to the chemicals, Bloom said. It may be challenging to totally cut out exposure to endocrine disruptors, Friedman said. “The biggest issue with EDCs is that they’re so pervasive in the environment and in everything we use,” she added. Skin care and personal care products are sources of exposure for both kids and adults both in the chemical makeup of the products themselves and in the plastic packaging they are in, Bloom said. Pesticides used in agriculture and found on produce may have endocrine disruptors, and groundwater may be contaminated as well, Friedman added. CNN reached out to the National Pest Management Association and the Personal Care Products Council for comment. “Believe it or not, fairly significant concentrations are found in home dust,” Bloom added. The presence in dust is especially a concern when it comes to toddler and infants who spend a lot of time close to the ground, he said. Many people of color are exposed to greater levels of endocrine disruptors, Bloom said. Some researchers have speculated that is because products marketed toward them, including hair care products, have higher concentrations, Bloom said. “Someone that’s going through their regular routine using their favorite personal care products, drinking water from their tap, eating produce –– they may be exposed to really, really small levels of EDCs in a lot of different ways that accumulate over the lifetime,” Friedman said. It can be difficult to tell what products may expose you to more endocrine disruptors just by looking at the label, Bloom said. The components of many products are proprietary, meaning protected by the company’s ownership, so they are not always clearly labeled, he added. “There’s no clear labeling requirements, and the industry may change what they use over time,” Bloom said. That means a product tested two years ago may be manufactured differently now and introduce different exposure levels, he added. “Scientific investigators, environmental health scientists, are constantly trying to play catch up with products being used by industry,” Bloom said. There are steps government agencies are taking to help protect consumers and more research still being done, according to an emailed statement from the US Environmental Protection Agency. “EPA has taken action to regulate these chemicals in the environment and provides additional scrutiny for chemicals, including pesticides, through the Endocrine Disruptor Screening Program,” the statement said. The prevalence of EDCs and a lack of clarity in labeling doesn’t mean there is nothing you can do, however. Friedman recommends finding manageable changes you can make that still fit with your budget, priorities and lifestyle. Gradually replacing personal care products one at a time as you use up individual products is a great place to start, she said. Filtering EDCs out of the water supply is also a manageable way to start, she added. There are plenty of reputable online databases available to the public to search for safer personal care products, such asSkinSafeProducts.com, developed by allergists and dermatologists with the Mayo Clinic, andSkin Deepfrom the EWG, Bloom said. It isn’t about overhauling everything –– Friedman has curly hair, so she sticks with her same shampoo and conditioner, but she finds products that she wouldn’t mind switching and makes changes there, she said. The EWG also has a tap water database so that people can search their drinking-water quality by zip code and use a water filtration guide to pick a system that is right for them. “It might not be so easy (for people) to change where they live, maybe even their water –– those sorts of environmental sources that are just part of your life: the air you breathe, the things you’re exposed to at work, etc.,” she said. “But personal care products is one thing where I think folks have a lot of autonomy and what they’re purchasing within reason.”",Not Found
50,"Catholic Church still failing to ensure clerical abuse is reported, Pope Francis’ commission says","Parts of the Roman Catholic Church are still failing to ensure clericalsexual abuseis reported adequately,Pope Francis’ commission for child protection said Tuesday, raising concerns about a “lack of transparency” in the Vatican’s handling of cases. In its first annual report, the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors surveyed safeguarding protocols from bishops in 17 different parts of the world, along with how the Church’s central administration processes cases. “At times, the commission found a troubling lack of reporting structures and victim/survivor accompaniment services,” the report said. “The commission found a persistent concern regarding the transparency in the Roman Curia’s (the church’s central administration) procedures and juridical processes. The commission notes that this will continue to foment distrust among the faithful, especially the victim/survivor community,” it added. The report includes several recommendations including compensation for survivors, a special “procurator” to represent victims, and for the pope to write an encyclical letter on the protection of children and vulnerable adults. It also comes after Francis’ trip to Belgium where he faced strong criticism for the church’s handling of abuse and where both King Philippe and Prime Minister Alexander De Croo called for more concrete action. At a news conference in the Vatican to launch the report, Cardinal O’Malley began by thanking survivors for speaking out and dedicated the report to them. He admitted “there is still much needing to be done,” expressed frustration about the slow pace of change but insisted the church is on “a journey towards a transparent and accountable ministry of safeguarding.” Joining him on the panel was Juan-Carlos Cruz, an abuse survivor for Chile and member of the Pontifical commission, who said the release of the report is an “important first step” in on-going efforts to tackle abuse in the church. He also thanked Pope Francis for “caring for survivors” and being invested in tackling the problem. On the lack of transparency in the Vatican’s handling of abuse, Cruz said that “not giving information to survivors” and having “opaque” investigations is a form of “re-trauma” to survivors. He pointed out that the commission’s report had made recommendations to tackle this. The production of the report was led by Maud de Boer Buquicchio, a former UN special rapporteur on the sexual exploitation of children and a member of the commission that was set up by the pope in 2014. Francis asked the commission two years ago to produce an annual report on child protection initiatives which he wanted to help bring “transparency and accountability” on abuse. The report looked at Papua New Guinea, one of the countries that the pope visited last month, finding that the bishops of Papua New Guinea and the neighboring Solomon Islands have “inadequate provision for different types of victim/survivor support services” and that “victims/survivors do not play a direct role in the formulation of Church safeguarding policy.” Meanwhile, in Cameroon, the commission found that “cultural challenges engender a hesitation to address the problem of abuse head-on” and that “this hesitation is shared by some church authorities.” The commission’s report includes criticisms of the Vatican office responsible for dealing with clerical sexual abuse cases, saying a lack of transparency and lengthy procedures “can be a source of re-traumatization” of victims. It said this body, the Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith, had only “publicly shared limited statistical information on its activities.” And when it came to the Vatican office responsible for clergy, the report cited a concern that “psychological assessments” for future priests “may be downplayed in the vetting procedures.” The report also cites concerns about anti-abuse procedures inside the church’s global charitable arm, Caritas, and citing the case of Luk Delft, who CNN reportedwas accused of abusing children while director of Caritas in the Central African Republic. The Vatican commission for protecting minors is led by Cardinal Sean O’Malley, the retired Archbishop of Boston, who has taken a significant role in the church’s response to the scourge of clerical sexual abuse. Although the report highlights several concerns about how abuse is being handled, it says there are “many other instances, the Commission was deeply encouraged by the robust and professional safeguarding regime.”",Global

52,Huge number of witches’ marks found at Tudor house in ‘astonishing’ discovery,"A “staggering array” of witches’ marks have been discovered on the walls of aTudorproperty inEngland. The carvings, which are formally known as apotropaic marks, were at the time believed to provide ritual protection against evil. News of the discovery, aptly timed to coincide with Halloween, was released by English Heritage, a charity that looks after hundreds of historic monuments, buildings and sites. Gainsborough Old Hall is a manor house in the eastern county of Lincolnshire that was once visited by Henry VIII and his then Queen, Catherine Howard, according to an English Heritage press release Tuesday. The markings were discovered by Rick Berry, an English Heritage volunteer who spent two years mapping around 20 carvings inside the grand building, according to the release. These include a “staggering array” of designs, according to English Heritage, though there’s a notable concentration in the servants’ wing of the hall. Among the marks found were simple circles that ordinarily would have been expected to have a six petal design inside - known as a hexafoil - to trap demons. One theory is that the petals may have faded away or that drawing them would have been beyond the skills of the carver, an English Heritage spokesperson told CNN in an email. Also found were overlapping Vs - known as Marian marks as they’re believed by some to be a call for protection from the Virgin Mary - and a pentangle that was used to protect against evil. Berry told CNN in an email sent by English Heritage: “I have been working as an English Heritage volunteer at Gainsborough for nearly 20 years and I know this property extremely well. So I was astonished when I noticed a previously undocumented protection mark a couple of years ago. “I decided to see if I could spot any more and I just keep finding them. The last one was a small pentagram and that was a few weeks ago, but who knows how many more there are still to find.” A curse appears to have been put on former owner William Hickman, who owned the property from 1596 as his name was found written upside down, the release adds. Defacing someone’s name was widely believed as a means to curse that person - though it is a practice more commonly associated with the Roman and Anglo Saxon period and has never previously been found at an English Heritage property. About 100 burn marks, which were thought to protect against fire, were also uncovered at the property. Kevin Booth, head of collections at English Heritage, said in the release: “It is astonishing that centuries on the amazing old buildings in our care still have secrets waiting to be discovered. “The Old Hall has undoubtedly had a tumultuous past, not least under the ownership of the apparently unpopular William Hickman, but why it’s the scene of quite such a high concentration of protective carvings remains a mystery.” The meaning of apotropaic comes from the Greek for averting evil. The marks are usually found carved into stone or wood, usually near entrances, doors, windows and fireplaces. Their purpose was to supposedly protect inhabitants and visitors from witches and evil spirits. In 2019, hundreds of witches’ marks were found scratched into the walls of an English cave system in the East Midlands, central England. Other apotropaic marks have been found in houses built between around 1550 and 1750. Experts say similar signs were scribed into churches and homes, as well as other caves, and were used to ward off sickness, death or poor harvests.",Global
53,Remember when Lindsay Lohan wore the unsexiest Halloween costume ever?,"If Halloween had a fashion handbook, the party scene from the 2004 classic “Mean Girls” would take up a whole chapter. Twenty years have passed since the original Plastics stomped their kitten heels into movie history, but the (now, rather outdated) observation Lindsay Lohan’s outcast-turned-”it girl” Cady Heron makes about “girl world” neatly summarizes the dichotomy of dressing for this most confusing of holidays. “In girl world, Halloween is the one night a year when a girl can dress up like a total slut and no other girls can say anything else about it.” In the movie, of course, Cady learns this far too late. Rocking up to a house filled with the cool kids from school, she makes a crucial early 2000s teenage girl error: Wearing a super spooky costume for a super spooky holiday. Donning fake teeth, a poofy wedding dress and veil, and just enough face paint to look totally deranged, Cady attends — not as a “zombie bride,” as her crush Aaron Samuels guesses — but an ex-wife. “Why are you dressed so scary?” her popular friend Karen Smith gasps when she sees her. Karen may have been borderline illiterate in the movie, but she still got the memo and stuck some mouse ears on top of a black negligee. Cady mumbles through her bloodied gums, “It’s Halloween?” And thus, the two extremes of the Halloween costume spectrum were given name: In 2004, you were either a sexpot with “some form of animal ears” or an undead hag. (Of course, this didn’t apply to men. Aaron arrives to the party dressed as generic football player guy andstillscores with the ladies.) Times have changed. But as the over-sexified energy of the early 2000s has somewhat chilled, the ghosts of the sexy mouse and the ex-wife still haunt some young women every autumn. Like an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other, they whisper: Be sexy!— No, be a bog witch! —Appeal to the male gaze!— No, hex them all! In the two decades since “Mean Girls,” came out, the Halloween costume spectrum has filled with more choice — and a lot of creativity. Take Heidi Klum, who has made a sport of debuting crazier and crazier costumes every October. In 2002, the model dressed up as fictional bombshell Betty Boop by donning a black, curly wig and figure-hugging red dress. By 2022, she was a disturbingly lifelike worm — breaking a part of the sexy-scary scale forever. Conversely, sexy can also be served with a healthy layer of irony, assuming “sexy” meansvery tinypieces of clothing. The apparel company Yandy, a mecca for Halloween costumes since 2007, has perfected the art of making people think, “Oh no, am I attracted to this?” with an extensive lineup of racy (insert literally any noun here) getups. Hot this year? Afigure-hugging Stanley Cup costume. At the same time, being a haunted bog witch has never been hotter. Dressing up sexy for Halloween has been going on for decades, but more people also seem to be embracing alternative aesthetics for the season. “Hot Girl Summer” now gives way to “Spooky Girl Fall,” and a lot of women can’t be bothered to add platform heels to a sexy taco costume when there are warm potions to sip and arcane rituals to perform. That makes Cady Heron’s ex-wife of Frankenstein costume even more of a classic. In the original 2004 movie, Queen Bee Regina George (Rachel McAdams) steps out in a bang-on Playboy Bunny outfit. In the 2024 movie musical, Regina (Reneé Rapp) picks a dramatic, yet less revealing look that resembles an elaborate bird of prey. The movie’s costume designer Tom Broecker says the change highlights the lethal cunning that lurks below the character’s beauty. “We knew that with Reneé’s version of Regina, the Playboy Bunny (costume) — the sexuality of it just didn’t seem current,” the movie’s costume designer Tom Broeckertold Buzzfeed. And yet, 2024 Cady still shows up with horrifying dentures and a ballooning white taffeta; a zombie bride among a sexy version of Joan of Arc, a husk of corn, and still — many animals. Maybe that’s another lesson for the Halloween handbook. Sexy comes and goes, but scary and off-putting is forever.",Global
54,Rodri and Aitana Bonmatí win men’s and women’s Ballon d’Or awards,"It was a successful night for Spanishsoccerat the Ballon d’Or awards ceremony – the annual soccer awards celebrating the best players in the men’s and women’s game. Manchester City and Spain midfielder Rodri won his first Ballon d’Or, whileBarcelonaand Spain star Aitana Bonmatí won her second consecutive Ballon d’Or Féminin during Monday’s presentation. There was a Spanish presence in a host of other awards at the ceremony in Paris, including the irrepressibly talented teenager Lamine Yamal picking up the award for best player under 21. Rodri had an exceptional 2024 and was crucial to both Manchester City’s and Spain’s success throughout the year. Manchester City won a record fourth consecutive Premier League title in 2024 and Spain were crowned champions at Euro 2024 this summer. “Incredible night for me today,” Rodri said after winning the trophy. “After all the hard work, after all the dark phases in my life, the dark times when I was working so hard to achieve those goals, the light has risen now,” the midfielder said per the broadcast’s English translator. Rodri credited his improvement in the final third in helping him win the award. “I was a traditional midfielder but once I realized that if I want to get better, I have to do better in the last third – assists, goals – and that’s why in the last years my presence in that sense in terms of goals has been increased.” The 28-year-old also thanked his club and international teammates for their part in his individual success. Rodri finished ahead of Real Madrid’s Vinícius Jr. and Jude Bellingham who finished second and third respectively. Vinícius and Bellingham helped lead Real Madrid to a record-extending 15th Champions League title in 2024, as well as another La Liga title. Bonmatí was once again crucial to Barcelona Femení’s success this year and won her second consecutive Ballon d’Or award. The midfielder helped lead Barcelona Femení to its first ever quadruple – winning titles in Liga F, the Champions League, the Spanish Super Cup and the Copa de la Reina. “I’m really thankful to be back here and win this award again,” Bonmati said after picking up the award, per the broadcast’s English translator. “But this is not an individual achievement, it is a group thing. I have a lot of luck to play with those amazing players that I play with everyday, it is because of them that I am the best player now.” Hollywood star Natalie Portman was on hand to present Bonmatí with her award. “Congratulations on a second win, it’s so extraordinary what you’ve achieved now two years in a row, and you are a hero to many of us out here,” Portman said before urging viewers to support and watch women’s soccer. Bonmatí beat out Barcelona Femení teammates Caroline Graham Hansen and Salma Paralluelo to the award. Graham Hansen finished second with Paralluelo in third respectively. “Tonight it’s me who won it but it could have been Caroline or Salma as well,” Bonmatí added. Barcelona players continued to pick up prizes and teenager Yamal took home the Kopa Trophy – the award given to the best under-21 player in men’s football. Despite being just 17 years of age, the tricky winger has been in blistering form for Barcelona over the last year and also played a key role in helping Spain win at Euro 2024. Yamal’s most recent success came in the historic fixture between Barcelona and Real Madrid. During Barcelona’s 4-0 win on Saturday, Yamal became the youngest goalscorer in El Clásico history at just 17 years and 106 days old.

55,"Steven Alderson was bullied at school for being autistic. Decades on, a historic win has made him an Australian national hero","Less than a fortnight ago, Steven Alderson was simply trying to get his head around the daunting size of the first international airport he’d ever set foot in and – more pressingly – find a KFC. A few days, plenty of chicken and 36 phenomenal holes ofgolflater, the 44-year-old was getting to grips with an even more important matter: the ever-ballooning size of his hero status back home inAustraliaand across the wider world. Victory at the Estrella Damm NA Andalucía Masters in Spain earlier this month made Alderson the first ever autistic winner on theGolf for the Disabled (G4D) Tour, a circuit run in association with – and parallel to – the DP World (European) Tour. Yet it was not solely the history-making nature of his triumph, nor the fact that it was achieved by a whopping nine-shot margin on his G4D debut, that saw him tee up and into the hearts of onlookers. Nor was it just the endearing origins of his “Spud” nickname, affectionately bestowed upon him as a nod to his overwhelmingly potato-based diet. Having grown up with various food allergies, Alderson – by his own admission – effectively lives on potato chips, fries and the like, with chicken the only meat he eats. Instead, the tide of popular support swelled from thewinner’s interviewa watery-eyed Alderson gave in the wake of triumph at Real Club de Golf Sotogrande. Fighting back tears, the victor recalled the years of bullying he had endured at school, and even some golf clubs. “Normal people just think people with disabilities are different and they’re probably easier to be bullied and picked on,” Alderson toldCNN Sport. “I got to the point where I was 15 years old and that was enough for me.” After switching schools five times due to bullying, Alderson left education at 15 – the earliest possible age at the time – and, searching for solace, immediately enrolled as a member at Willunga Golf Club in South Australia. That decision is reaping dividends now, with Alderson’s triumph and subsequent raw revelations triggering a global outpouring of love from those who saw the footage across various social media platforms. “Okay, that does it, Steven Alderson is our favorite golfer,” read the caption from Australian news outlet 10 News First for aTikTok clipof the interview that has amassed three million views to date. “Do I care about golf? No. Do I want this man to succeed at everything he ever sets his mind to? Yes, absolutely,” the top comment read. Shaking off a few nights of big celebrations and little sleep, last week Alderson was back at Willunga to compete in a celebrity Pro-Am event alongside two national cricket stars, Callum Ferguson and Alex Ross. He can scarcely contain his excitement when he shares news that he has been invited to tee up in a Pro-Am prior to LIV Golf Adelaide at The Grange in February, a tournament and league organized by Australian golfing royalty Greg Norman. Alderson never envisioned himself as a celebrity, but the reality is becoming increasingly hard to ignore. “It’s been crazy over here,” he said. “I’m like the next biggest thing at the moment, all over the world and on the internet.” Fortunately, Alderson is blessed with an ally who is well accustomed to keeping the golfer’s feet on the ground: caddie Trent Blucher. Once members of the same club, the pair have known each other for almost two decades. It meant that, even though life had seen them lose contact somewhat in recent years, Alderson had no doubts who he wanted on his bag for Spain. “Trent understands my disabilities and my likes and dislikes, which helps,” Alderson said. “It’s a good partnership.” That understanding proved vital during Alderson’s few moments of jeopardy at Sotogrande. Having powered into a two-shot lead courtesy of a five-under 67 opening round, the Australian looked to be cantering home after an early eagle helped him arrive at the 15th tee with a commanding lead. Yet disaster struck when Alderson subsequently got into bunker trouble. With premonitions of a horror choke flashing through his mind, a few years ago he may have succumbed to the fear and subsequent frustration – “blowing up,” as the pair term it. Blucher, though, has become adept at containing the blast radius. “I’ve known Spud for a long time, so I know if he’s having a mini blow-up,” Blucher said. “Sometimes, you just gotta let him because that’s how Spud is. Then other times, I need to just stand in front of him and go, ‘You’re wrong. You should own it.’” “There’s no point in me being right – it’s about just helping him. If I can help him just one time through a round of golf, then that’s my role and I’m happy to do so,” he added. A superb long putt saw Alderson limit the damage with a double bogey before easing home at seven-under par overall and sharing a long hug with Blucher. No other player in the field finished below par. “Trent is amazing at making sure everything’s relaxed, heart rates not racing,” he explained. “Just keeping everything in check and going through the process for every shot.” Victory in Spain – swiftly followed by another in the Webex All Abilities Players Series South Australia at Willunga on Sunday – stamped Alderson and Blucher’s ticket for their next big adventure, a trip to Dubai for the season-ending G4D Tour Series Finale in November. The duo will have to draw up a new checklist for the United Arab Emirates, having completed their three-point inventory for Spain: bring the trophy home, visit the Tour equipment trucks and meetJon Rahm. Alderson is keen to introduce two-time major champion Rahm to the famed wines of the McLaren Vale region when the LIV Golf star touches down in Adelaide for February’s event, with the Spanish star known to be a food and drink connoisseur. Rahm’sBasque-inspired Masters champions menuearlier this year will have done little for Alderson’s pallet, but the Australian’s willingness to embrace the unknown hints at personal victories that can be measured in more than just silverware and social media fame. From navigating Qatar’s dizzyingHamad International airportto working through language barriers at Spanish restaurants, the trip threw up a wealth of new experiences that Blucher believes will benefit Alderson in immeasurable ways. “By the time we came back a week later, not only did he have the trophy in his hand, but he was strutting around that airport – he knew how to get around, he was leading me to where the KFC was,” Blucher recalled. “’To travel is to live,’ is the quote, and to see Spud have that sort of experience which golf has provided for him, it’s one of those chapters in his life – a life journey and life lessons that you just can’t think to guess you’re gonna learn prior.” When the next chapter begins in Dubai, Alderson may well recruit a whole new swath of fans, but perhaps the people he is most keen to catch the eyes of are those he can relate to most. “If you’re being bullied, just do your best to ignore it and be the better person,” he said. “You’re gonna be the better person in the long run when you’re older, anyway.”",Global

57,"A man was wheeled into surgery to harvest his organs. Weeks later, he left the hospital alive","Three years ago, Anthony Hoover woke up in a Kentucky hospital to find people shaving his chest, bathing his body in surgical solution and talking about harvesting his organs. Hoover, known as TJ, was 33 years old and had been hospitalized after an overdose. Doctors seemed to be trying everything, his family members said, but the news had been crushing: brain damage, lack of reflexes, emptiness in his eyes. Medical staff said he was brain-dead, TJ’s sister, Donna Rhorer, told CNN — a conclusion spelled out in black and white in his medical records – and they planned to remove life support. TJ was also registered as an organ donor. He was young and relatively healthy. His family heard from an organization then called Kentucky Organ Donor Affiliates, or KODA,about all the lives he could save as his was ending. They agreed that they should do as he wished and allow his organs to go to people in need. On October 29, 2021, TJ was wheeled to the OR for the five-hour procedure. Less than two hours later, a staff member came to talk with his family. “He’s not ready,” they said. “He woke up.” TJ’s family thought it was a miracle. But former employees of the organ procurement organization working on TJ’s case say it was a breach of trust – one called it a “disaster” — that a man who was making eye contact, shaking his head “no” and thrashing on the table should never have been in the operating room, that a man who left the hospital to live with family weeks later shouldn’t have been at risk of losing his life. The hospital, Baptist Health in Richmond, Kentucky, and the organ procurement group declined interviews with CNN. The hospital said in a statement that “the safety of our patients is always our highest priority. We work closely with our patients and their families to ensure our patients’ wishes for organ donation are followed.” KODA, now known as Network for Hope since a merger with another organ procurement network, said it has reviewed the case and “remains confident that accepted practices and approved protocols were followed.” It also says the case has been “inaccurately represented,” including by “individuals never involved with this case.” But disturbing details about TJ’s case — including allegations of pressure to harvest his organs despite signs that he was aware and resisting — recently prompted Kentucky’s attorney general to investigate whether criminal charges are warranted in this case. At the federal level, the Health Resources and Services Administration, through the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network, is investigating, as well. A bipartisancongressional Oversight and InvestigationsSubcommittee that heard about the case this fall has also been looking into the incident. And critics of the country’s organ procurement system say TJ’s story is not unique. Withoutmajor reform and oversight, they worry that it could happen again and that not all patients will be lucky enough to survive. By October 2021, TJ Hoover had struggled with anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder, his sister said. He had dropped out of high school years earlier, after he lost two brothers to drug addiction. At 16, he joined the Job Corps in search of a sense of purpose, but he could never shake memories of the dead bodies that he said he saw when he was sent to clean up after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Prescribed medications left him feeling like a zombie, she said, and made it difficult to work. Eventually, he turned to illicit drugs to help cope. “Knowing what drugs did to his brothers, he would try to quit and was occasionally successful,” Rhorer said. But not on the night of October 25, 2021. His mother had died months before, and that would have been her birthday. TJ went outside to load his car and was later found face-down on the pavement. He had overdosed. When EMTs arrived, TJ had no pulse and wasn’t breathing. They performed CPR, shocked his heart and rushed him to nearby Baptist Health. A scan in the emergency room revealed that TJ had brain damage, but doctors couldn’t say how serious it was because of swelling. TJ was transferred to the ICU. “I felt like the doctor was doing everything he could,” said Rhorer, 48. She snapped photos and videos of her baby brother and eventually posted some on TikTok, hoping to show what a drug overdose could do to someone and deter others from the same fate. The next day, workers at the hospital tested his reflexes, putting objects in his pocket and hands, but he didn’t show improvement. “As for his eyes, there wasn’t anything,” Rhorer told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta. She said the hospital told her that another scan showed no brain activity. At that point, hospital staff talked to the family about changing TJ’s status toDo Not Resuscitate, which would keep him from receiving CPR if his heart stopped beating or if he stopped breathing. With little change two days after the overdose, TJ’s family allowed it. Rhorer said they expected health-care workers to come to remove life support, but instead, representatives from KODA arrived. TJ’s name was on the organ donor registry, they told Rhorer. His organs could save multiple lives if his family would honor his wishes. “Of course, if that were his wishes,” she told them. About170 million people in the USare signed up to donate organs when they die, butless than 1%of those who register can actually donate. Consequently,about 17people in the United States die every day waiting for a transplant. “If I lost my brother and eight people could live, then I felt like my brother wouldn’t die in vain,” Rhorer said later. The medical records Rhorer has for TJ say he was “declared brain-dead patient being maintained for harvesting of organs” on October 29. TJ underwent procedures to make sure his organs were fit for donation, and that afternoon, hospital workers came to the family and told them it was time. They held what’s known asan honor walk, a tradition in many hospitals when someone donates organs. A video shot by Rhorer’s friend andposted on TikTokshows TJ in a bed being rolled down a corridor. Hospital staff stop what they are doing, line the halls and stand in silence in their blue scrubs and white coats. Some hold tissues and dab at their eyes. The walk pauses so TJ’s family can see him one more time. A man in a camo hat and flannel bends to kiss his forehead, and others lean forward to tell TJ they love him. Although it’s hard to see TJ, a person in scrubs says reassuringly, “sometimes they do respond, with some reflexes,” and then asks them to stop filming out of respect for patient privacy. Notes from the case say that TJ’s eyes were open all the way down to the OR. Everyone thought this was goodbye until a couple hours later, when they heard that TJ was awake. After Nycki Martin put her five kids to bed, she usually studied for med school acceptance tests; she wants to be a surgeon. But one night in January 2024, she was winding down with TikTok instead. She had worked in organ procurement and was swiping through videos, looking for organ donor stories. Organ donation, Martin said, is “such a beautiful mission and saved so many lives when it’s done right.” She discovered a video of TJ’s honor walk. Over the video, the text said, “TJ Honor Walk But God!!” with a prayer emoji.  The comments explained what “but God” meant: The patient had woken up. “I was like ‘That sounds familiar; it must have happened to someone else,’ ” Martin said. It reminded her of a case she was aware of through her previous work at KODA. Looking closer, she recognized people in the video and realized it was the same case. “The family trusted everyone involved,” she said. “I just feel like there were so many opportunities for someone to step in and say, we’re not doing the right thing.” She decided to message TJ’s sister. Martin, who worked as a surgical preservationist for KODA for about a year, was not in the room when TJ was being prepped for surgery, but she had been heading to Richmond as staff relief. She said she got constant updates from people who were there, and they were upset that that patient was awake. Martin suspected that the family didn’t know the same side of the story she did — and as it’s described in medical records viewed later by CNN. In those treatment records, an eyewitness account of a heart catheterization – ordered by KODA and performed at Baptist Health several hours before TJ’s organs were expected to be harvested – noted that TJ had “purposeful movement to pain” during the heart procedure. His eyes were “open and tracking,” and he was “thrashing around.” According to the record, the cardiologist  commented, “I am no neurologist, but if I would most certainly call this purposeful movement, and they should not have said that patient was not going to have a meaningful recovery with these reflexes.” Instead of stopping the procedure, the cardiologist gave TJ a paralytic called rocuronium and sedated him further with midazolam and fentanyl so the test could be completed. The record added that hospital staffers were “extremely uncomfortable with the amount of reflexes” and that some complained that “this was euthanasia.” According to the record, the representative for KODA explained that “it was the families [sic] decision to terminally extubate the patient prior to KODA approaching for donation and this is another opportunity to donate still.” Rhorer has hundreds of pages of TJ’s records printed from the hospital medical records department, and she keeps them in a binder that’s always close by. But she did not have this record, and she said they were never told what happened during the catheterization. Rhorer learned more details after Martin got in touch with her. Martin also got in touch with a patient advocacy organizationcalled Organizeto tell them about TJ’s case, and she wrote a letter to Congress describing what happened. Rhorer’s attorneys have requested all of TJ’s records from the hospital and from the organ procurement organization but said they have not received the ones from KODA. When activists first read the catheterization record to Rohrer over the phone in September 2024, she sat at her kitchen table and cried. Had she fully understood that TJ wasn’t brain-dead and that he had woken up during the heart catheterization, she said, the family would have made a different choice. “We would never have sent him for his organs to be harvested,” she said. There are circumstances in which a patient who isn’t brain-dead may still become an organ donor. It’s called donation after circulatory death,or DCD, and it has become much more common in recent years, althoughsome expertsquestion the ethics of the practice. “The way DCD is supposed to work is, you’ve got somebody with essentially devastating illness or injury, and their families decided to withdraw life support,” explained Dr. Robert Cannon, an associate professor of surgery and surgical director of theliver transplant programat the University at Alabama Birmingham. Cannon did not work on TJ’s case but was familiar with it because he testified aboutlapsesin the organ procurement system at theHouse Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations Subcommitteehearing where TJ’s case came to light. “Certainly, we have potential DCD donors with lots of reflexes,” Cannon said. “But as long as the family knows this is what’s happening with their loved one, this process is considered ethical and standard.” What isn’t ethical, he said, is undue pressure to continue. He has been in an operating room where a patient exhibited reflexes that suggested they were not brain-dead, but he says the organ procurement agency encouraged him to harvest the organs anyway. In that case, the procedure was stopped. One person who was in the operating room for TJ’s case felt that it went too far. Natasha Miller was an organ perfusionist - the person who packages the organs after they’ve been removed - with KODA at the time of TJ’s case, although she no longer works for the organization. An hour ahead of TJ’s procedure, she was in the OR at Baptist Health to prep equipment and brief hospital staff on what to expect, especially with a DCD case, in which patients may open their eyes or move. “It is very shocking for people who have never experienced it before,” she said. As Miller headed to the hospital the day of TJ’s procedure, she got texts that questioned why the organ procurement was happening, since TJ seemed aware and resisting. “No one was comfortable doing the case from the hospital,” she said. But KODA was “pushing, pushing, pushing to go.” Miller and a trainee arrived at the hospital, where she said hospital staff was “very agitated.” She warned her trainee that “not everyone is pro-KODA.” When Miller, an award-winning body builder and an unflappable former Marine, saw TJ for the first time, she could understand the concern. He thrashed around the entire time, and hospital staff was telling him to calm down. “This was no ordinary movement,” Miller said. “He was very aware.” Despite TJ’s agitation, the process continued. He was draped and shaved. Miller said she noticed tears rolling down his face. He kept shaking his head as if to say no. “I can’t even imagine, probably, the fear he felt,” Miller said. In typical DCD cases, family and a doctor who is not from the organ procurement team are there for the patient’s final moments. The doctor removes the life-sustaining equipment and waits. Sometimes, it can take more than an hour for a patient to die. Once it’s clear that their heart is no longer beating, the family leaves. The doctor waits another five minutes and listens to the heart and lungs, and only then does that doctor pronounce the patient dead.That’s when the procurement team gets to work. In TJ’s case, it never got that far. “The pronouncing physician, she comes in, takes one look at him and says, ‘No, I’m not doing this. He has way too much function,’” Miller said. The record activists say is from KODA said that the doctor felt this was “inhumane” and “unethical.” The coordinator from KODA told the doctor she’d been trying to get the case shut down all day, Miller said. Miller added that the KODA coordinator called her manager, who yelled and pushed to get another doctor to pronounce TJ dead. The coordinator was in tears, Miller said, and the doctor who was supposed to do the organ procurement was upset and left. “It was just a disaster,” Miller said. The procedure was stopped. KODA told CNN in a written statement that TJ was “not eligible” to become a brain-dead donor but was qualified to donate after his circulation stopped. When his condition improved, the organization did not attempt to recover his organs, it said. Miller said that as soon as the staff told TJ they’d take him back to the ICU, he calmed down. “So that’s how we know he was very aware,” Miller said. TJ spent the next few weeks at the hospital. Employees there suggested sending him to an out-of-state nursing home, but Rhorer took him to her home in Richmond instead. Doctors said TJ would not get better, she told CNN. For the first four months, doctors told her he wasn’t well enough for therapy. Rhorer spent so much time caring for TJ, she lost her job as a restaurant manager. Instead, she made it her job to heal her brother. Rhorer helped build TJ’s strength so much that he became fit for therapy, and he was able to walk his sister down the aisle at her wedding in May 2023. TJ has challenges, including limited short-term memory, vision issues and balance problems. But he’s strong enough for physical therapy several times a week, and he still has a sense of humor. Admire his tattoos, and he’ll show two fists: Across his right knuckles, it says “Y’all,” and across his left, it says “suck.” “We’re blessed, because he’s not supposed to be here,” Rhorer said. “He wasn’t supposed to make it a year, and he made it, and we’re three years in, and he’s thriving.” When Rhorer talks to TJ about what happened at the hospital, he sometimes asks why people were trying to kill him. Other times, he expresses guilt that his organs didn’t save others. “He has survivor’s guilt,” Rhorer said. She believes that the family was misinformed about TJ’s condition and that people were dismissive of her brother. His humanity got lost, she said. “He’s an overdose,” Rhorer said. “I think they saw organs where we saw a family member. “To them, it was just their day job.” She keeps dozens of painful images of TJ’s hospitalization in an album. She still posts videos onTikTok,knowing that her posts from 2021 helped piece together her brother’s story. “I had no idea what I was getting myself into,” Rhorer said. Until she saw the TikTok message from Martin, she believed that her brother’s survival was a miracle that came at just the right moment. And a part of her still thinks this is a miracle. On her back porch, there’s a bright blue chair with TJ’s handwritten initials and dates: his birth date, the day his heart stopped beating and the day doctors stopped the procedure that would have ended his life. On the seat of the chair is a Bible verse, John 11:25-26: “I am the resurrection, and the life: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet should live. And whomever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.” Now, her determination to help TJ extends beyond the physical. She is telling their story so what happened to her baby brother doesn’t ever happen to anyone else. “Organ donation is a beautiful thing,” Rhorer said. “What can you give somebody more precious than love? But at the same time, it shouldn’t be abused.” CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta, Nadia Kounang and Amanda Sealy contributed to this report. Videos by Lacey Russell and Deborah Brunswick.",Not Found
58,Scientists say skeletal remains found in castle well belong to figure from 800-year-old saga,"Researchers have connected the identity of skeletal remains found in a well at Norway’s Sverresborg castle to a passage in a centuries-old Norse text. The 800-year-oldSverris saga, which follows the story of the real-life King Sverre Sigurdsson, includes the tossing of the body of a dead man — later known as “Well-man” — down a well during a military raid in central Norway in 1197. It’s likely, according to the text, that raiders lobbed the body into the well to poison the main water source for locals, but little else is said about the man or who he was in the saga. Researchers initially uncovered the bones in the castle’s well in 1938, but they were only able to carry out a visual analysis at the time. Now, scientists have an array of analytical techniques at their disposal, including genetic sequencing and radiocarbon dating. A new study on the remains, published Friday in the Cell Press journaliScience, reveals unprecedented insights into Well-man’s appearance based on in-depth research on samples of his teeth. “This is the first time that a person described in these historical texts has actually been found,” said study coauthor Michael D. Martin, a professor in the department of natural history at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology’s University Museum in Trondheim, in a statement. “There are a lot of these medieval and ancient remains all around Europe, and they’re increasingly being studied using genomic methods.” The findings not only shed fresh light on what Well-man looked like but also who he was, with a surprising twist about how he ended up in a Norse saga. The Sverris saga is a window into the ambitious rise of King Sverre, who lived from 1152 to 1202 and reigned over Norway during the second half of the 12th century. The text includes revelations about Norway’s early history, describing periods of political instability and conflict — with wars caused by disputes over who would succeed to the throne after King Sigurd Munn, according to the study. Sverre threw his name into the mix when he claimed to be a son of Munn. Munn was killed by his brother in 1155, which sparked the succession scuffle. While many of the Norse sagas derive from oral traditions and older lost manuscripts, the Sverris story appears to have been written in tandem with the events described within it — by someone close to the king. The text is rich in detail, including full names, locations, battles and military strategy as well as Sverre’s speeches. Throughout the narrative, Sverre’s men are referred to as Birkebeiner, meaning ”birch legs,” reportedly due to their use of primitive birch bark as footwear and leg coverings. Meanwhile, Sverre’s opponents, organized by representatives of the Roman Catholic Church, were called the Baglers, derived from the Norse “bagall,” meaning ”bishop wand,” the study authors noted. In 1197, as King Sverre spent the winter in Bergen along Norway’s western coast, the Baglers carried out a surprise attack hundreds of miles away against Sverresborg castle, which the monarch built in 1180 in what’s now the city of Trondheim. The Bagler army crept into the stronghold through a secret door as residents dined, burning everything inside, according to the study. Well-man appears in one line in the text: “They took a dead man and cast him into the well, and then filled it up with stones.” Some of his skeletal remains were uncovered beneath large stones during an excavation of the well in 1938.More of his bones turned up in new excavations in 2014 and 2016 along the southern side of the well, including parts of his left hand (the left arm was missing) and skull, which researchers found disconnected from the body. Research carried out along with the more recent excavations suggested that the bones belonged to a man 30 to 40 years old at the time of death. It’s been difficult for scientists to determine how much of the trauma recorded by his bones occurred after death, but a blunt force injury to the rear left part of the skull, as well as two sharp cuts in the skull, likely happened before he died, according to the study authors. For the latest study, Martin and his colleagues wanted to bring together historical, archaeological and genetic context for Well-man’s remains. An initial radiocarbon dating analysis helped the research team confirm that Well-man’s remains were about 900 years old, which aligns with the timeline in the Sverris saga. The team was hoping to sequence Well-man’s genome from his bones, given that they appeared to be in good condition, but surprisingly, the DNA was poorly preserved inside them, Martin said. Lead study author Dr. Martin Ellegaard at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology instead used samples of a tooth to sequence the genome, which enabled the team to discover that Well-man likely had a medium skin tone, blue eyes, and blond or light-brown hair. The researchers collaborated with Agnar Helgason to compare Well-man’s genome with the genomes of anonymous modern Norwegians stored in reference databases at Iceland’s deCODE Genetics, where Helgason is the head of anthropology. The results showed that Well-man was closely related to people in southern Norway. King Sverre’s defeated army came from parts of central Norway, while the raiding Baglers were from the south. “The biggest surprise for all of us was that the Well-man did not come from the local population, but rather that his ancestry traces back to a specific region in southern Norway. That suggests the sieging army threw one of their own dead into the well,” Martin said. While it’s impossible to know the true intent of the Baglers when they threw the body down the well, the Sverris saga says the raiders wanted to make the castle uninhabitable and undefendable for King Sverre and his people. Placing a corpse into the only nearby source of drinking water would cause pollution, which may have been amplified if Well-man had a disease. No pathogens were discovered when studying Well-man’s teeth, but that may have been due to the destructive techniques used in examining the tooth. To sequence Well-man’s genome, the researchers had to remove the tooth’s outer surface to avoid contamination potentially caused by anyone who previously handled it during excavation, and then ground half the tooth into powder, which means the sample can’t be used for future tests. But other teeth from the remains could be tested. “Though there are other teeth available from this individual we need to consider if new techniques in the future will provide additional information than what is available with today’s methods,” Ellegaard said. “Another consideration is the scientific value we obtain. In this case we only have one side of the story — the saga — which has a clear agenda, and so here we can justify our approach to corroborate the one-sided written words, as opposed to if there were several records or other means of data available.” Maja Krzewińska, a researcher at the Centre for Palaeogenetics in Stockholm, Sweden, found the study’s methodology to be well-executed but said she was most impressed that the remains could be linked to an event described in a historical source. Krzewińska was not involved in the study. “There is always uncertainty about such old descriptions, so finding a correctly dated male skeleton in this context already adds to the interpretation,” Krzewińska wrote in an email.“However, showing that his genetic origin may have been in southern rather than central Norway, as was originally expected, changes our perception of the circumstances surrounding the decision of the victors to deposit this particular human carcass in the well. It opens up new possibilities for interpretation (for why the body was dumped) and allows for a deeper understanding and novel insights into stories we thought were largely understood.” While Well-man’s exact identity may never be known, he’s now more than just the anonymous “dead man” from the saga, Martin said. “Archaeological science, ancient DNA and genetic analyses give us tools to separate fact from fiction, which eventually should give us a more objective and complete view of human history,” Martin said.",Not Found
59,Most space travelers face the same debilitating ailment. The experience of 4 civilian astronauts could offer answers,"Each of the four crew members aboard SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn mission reported different physical sensations during their history-making trip, which sent the private astronauts into a higher orbit around Earth than any human has ventured in decades. “My vision acuity started to deteriorate those first few days,” Scott “Kidd” Poteet, a former US Air Force pilot, told CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a recent interview. His crewmate Anna Menon, a SpaceX engineer who was thePolaris Dawn mission’smedical officer, said she was struck by space adaptation syndrome. It’s a phenonmenon that affects roughly60% to 80% of peoplewho travel to orbit, though astronauts rarely openly discuss the ailment. “It can be a whole spectrum of experience from lightheadedness, nausea, all the way to vomiting,” Menon said. “I experienced really the whole gamut.” Traveling to space — with its jarringg-forcesand disorienting weightlessness — can have a variety of effects on the human body, ranging from the uncomfortable to the downright dangerous. NASA has long known about and studied these ailments, as the agency’s astronauts have reported such symptoms for decades. But the Polaris Dawn mission — a five-day journey to orbit carried out by the private sector rather than NASA — sought to take that research further, hoping to unravel some of the most troublesome aspects of spaceflight. During the mission, the crew carried out a variety of health-focused experiments, including wearing special contact lenses that measured the pressure in their eyes and undergoing MRI scans to track changes to the anatomy of their brains. The Polaris Dawn team pursued those answers because the mission aims to pave the way for more people to venture into space, noted Jared Isaacman, the billionaire founder of payment technology company Shift4. Isaacman helped fund and was commander of the unprecedented mission. “Some 600 people have been to orbit in the last 60 years — more than half have gotten space adaptation syndrome,” Isaacman said. “And you’re talking about (mostly government astronauts) — some of the most highly screened individuals. … That’s just underscoring the importance of why we have to solve this, if we’re going toput hundreds or thousands of people in space one day.” SpaceX’s founding goal is to fly the first humans to Mars and eventually establish a settlement there. “If you think of a future where there’s thousands of people living in space and they eventually — after nine months’ travel — you get to the surface of Mars, and a huge percentage (of people) have vision changes that make them unable to do their work, unable to read their procedures — that’s a big problem,” Menon said of why SpaceX hopes to find answers to pressing in-space medical conditions. During the September mission, the Polaris Dawn crew conducted thefirst commercial spacewalkas well as ventured into the lower band of Earth’s Van Allen radiation belts, which are areas within Earth’s magnetic field where pools of radiation from the sun lie trapped. Initial reports from the Polaris Dawn crew did not necessarily reveal any specific health effects from radiation exposure, although Isaacman said he saw “sparkles or lights” when he closed as eyes, just as other NASAastronauts who have ventured through high-radiation environments havereported. This phenomenon isnot yet well understood. However, Poteet said his vision was noticeably less sharp during the first few days in space, which may point to a condition called spaceflight associated neuro-ocular syndrome,or SANS. NASAestimatesas many as 70% of astronauts experience this condition, which may be caused by shifting bodily fluid, resulting in pressure changes in the eyes. Poteet’s vision changes may have shown up in the data collected by the special contact lenses worn by the crew, which they nicknamed the “cyborg experiment.” The contacts were designed to collect data on interocular pressure over the course of their mission, Menon said. “This is novel because you’re getting long-duration data. And you can then really better understand how that transition occurs over the course of time and especially that early time in space,” she said. “We are really interested to see what the researchers come back with when they have the chance to look through all this data.” Dr. Allison Hayman, a researcher and associate professor at the University of Colorado Boulder, which led the cyborg experiment, said Friday that researchers had not yet received preliminary data from the mission. In all, the Polaris Dawn team carried out 36 experiments on behalf of31 partner institutions, including universities and NASA. Back on Earth, Poteet reported that his vision quickly returned to normal. And while he had unfortunate vision lapses during the journey, Poteet said he was pleased to report he did not experience any of the nausea typically associated with space adaptation syndrome, which he called “fairly ironic.” “People assume there’s a correlation between motion sickness (on Earth) and space adaptation syndrome,” he said. “I have a tendency to get motion sickness in the back of an Uber. … But I actually didn’t experience those symptoms (in space).” Menon noted she wasn’t as lucky. “It really gave me just a huge appreciation for how it can impact your ability to work and get things done, especially in those early adaptation days,” Menon said. Before takeoff, Isaacman — the only crew member with previous space travel experience — told CNN that medication administered to treat space adaptation syndrome symptoms can put people to sleep for eight hours or so. (He led a previous self-funded trip to orbit calledInspiration4in 2021.) Sarah Gillis, a lead SpaceX operations engineer who was a mission specialist aboard Polaris Dawn, also noted that crew members had their blood drawn before and after the mission to evaluate how their bodies processed drugs — such asacetaminophen (or Tylenol)— in orbit versus on Earth. Another experiment that the Polaris Dawn crew underwent to understand in-space ailments involved a series of MRI scans just before liftoff and immediately after returning to Earth. The crew even had a portable imaging machine right outside their quarantine facility, Isaacman said. Doing so allowed the team to collect data even faster than NASA has collected such scans on astronauts after returning from space, Menon said. “Even those MRI results show changes to the brain anatomy,” she said. The changes have included brains shifting upward in astronauts’ skulls, according to Dr. Donna Roberts, deputy chief scientist at the ISS National Laboratory who has spentyears researchingthe affects of spaceflight on brain structure. Roberts on Thursday noted that initial reviews of the MRI data “did not show any clinically concerning findings.” Spaceflight can also enlarge fluid-filled cavities at the center of the brain, called ventricles, Roberts added. “We don’t quite understand why that’s happening,” she said. Gillis, whose job at SpaceX includes training NASA astronauts headed for orbit, said in a CNN interview before liftoff that “human spaceflight is not going to be glamorous all the time” because of the discomfort microgravity can wreak on the human body. Upon her return, Gillis reflected on the effects. “It’s been so incredibly fascinating to actually go through all of those changes to see how your body responds, and how the fluid shift impacts you, and how all of your organs kind of shift inside you,” she said. “We don’t thrive without atmosphere, without oxygen,” Gillis added. “I think that really just underscores the importance to me of the research we are doing, the data we’re collecting.”",Global
60,Stunning fossil trapped in amber reveals previously unknown species that lived during the time of dinosaurs,"When dinosaurs roamed Earth, their surroundings looked very different than the world of today. But there were also some similarities. And now scientists have confirmed a new one: Diverse firefly species lit up the night during thelate Mesozoic. The discovery comes from a fossil of an ancient firefly species that was initially discovered in 2016, trapped in 99 million-year-oldBurmese amberfrom northern Myanmar. The beetle is only the second firefly species from the Mesozoic to be identified. Scientists estimated that fireflies evolved aerial bioluminescence, the ability to glow during flight, at least 100 million years ago in aJuly 2022 studythat analyzed the first Mesozoic firefly fossil that was described in 2015. But because firefly remains from this period can be difficult to come by since the insects’ softer bodies don’t preserve well in the fossil record, the evolution of the beetles and their bioluminescence has been difficult to pinpoint, experts say. The recently identified species, dubbed Flammarionella hehaikuni, could help researchers better understand the early evolution of fireflies and this characteristic trait, according to a study published September 11 in the journalProceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences. “The fossil helps bridge gaps in understanding the evolutionary history of the lampyroid beetles (thebeetle familyfireflies belong to) and shows that key traits, like abdominal light organs, have remained consistent since the mid-Cretaceous,” said lead study author Chenyang Cai, professor at Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing, in an email. “How cool is it that dinosaurs once saw fireflies flying at dusk?” Upon first look of the firefly fossil in 2016, Cai said he thought the insect was a type of beetle in the Elateroidea family — similar to a separate species Cai also helped to identify from Burmeseamber in 2021— due to the fossilized insect’s unique serrate antennae that modern fireflies do not have. But when he revisited the peculiar fossil described in the new study in late 2022, Cai noticed the well-preserved light organ, a characteristic of fireflies. There are10 past firefly speciesthat are only known from fossils, said Dr. Oliver Keller, a research museum collection specialist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor who has studied the systematics and taxonomy of fireflies. “The significance of this discovery is in the rarity of fossils of fireflies from that period,” Keller said via email. Because only one other Cretaceous firefly species has been identified, “this new species can be used to revisit the (July 2022 study) to better date the evolution of fireflies given the new evidence,” he added. Keller was not part of the new study or the 2022 research. Fireflies glow for amultitude of reasons, most commonly as a defense mechanism and a way to communicate and attract mates. While it is hard to speculate how the flashes would have looked 100 million years ago, it is possible they would have looked similar to those seen today, Keller said. The study authors named the beetle as a homage to French astronomer Camille Flammarion and Haikun He,an amateur collectorwho had donated several other amber specimens to the authors, according to the study. There are more than 2,000 firefly species found today, according to the Natural History Museum in London. The study authors hypothesize that the newly reported ancient firefly species belonged to the Luciolinae, a subfamily that currently includes about 450 species, due to the placement of the light organ on the insect’s abdomen, said study coauthor Dr. Robin Kundrata, an entomologist and an associate professor in the department of zoology at the Palacký University Olomouc in the Czech Republic. However, no existing Luciolinae species sports the peculiar antennae that the fossil had, which the authors suspect would also differ depending on the sex of the insect, according to the study. The newly identified fossil is that of a female. What’s more, the firefly fossil, which measures less than 1 centimeter (0.4 inch) long, is morphologically different from the other specimen identified in 2015, showing that the light organs of Mesozoic species were more diverse than once thought but still similar to ones in modern fireflies, Kundrata said in an email. The authors said they hope more firefly fossils from the Mesozoic will come to light to further scientists’ understanding of the mysterious origins of the bioluminescent beetles. “Based on the recent knowledge, fireflies originated in the Mesozoic Era although the more precise period of their origin remains unclear. … Future discoveries may reveal further information on their diversity and morphology,” Kundrata said. “Since there is no information about the immature stages of fireflies from their early evolution, we would be happy for discoveries of fossil larval specimens from Mesozoic.”",Global
61,Groundbreaking telescope reveals first piece of new cosmic map,"Greetings, earthlings! I’m Jackie Wattles, and I’m thrilled to be a new name bringing awe to your inbox. I’ve covered space exploration for nearly a decade at CNN, and there has never been a more exciting time to follow space and science discoveries. As researchers push forward to explore and understand the cosmos, advancements in technology are sparking rapid developments in rocketry, astronomical observatories and a multitude of scientific instruments. Look no further than the missions racing to unlock dark matter and the mysterious force known as dark energy, both so named precisely because science has yet to explain these phenomena. Astronomers have never detected dark matter, but they believe it makes up about 85% of the total matter in the universe. Meanwhile, the existence of dark energy helps researchers explain why the universe is expanding — and why that expansion is speeding up. Extraordinary new scientific instruments are churning out trailblazing data, ready to reshape how scientists view the cosmos. A prime example is the European Space Agency’s wide-angle Euclid telescope that launched in 2023 to investigate the riddles of dark energy and dark matter. Euclid this weekdelivered the first piece of a cosmic map— containing about 100 million stars and galaxies — that will take six years to create. These stunning 3D observations may help scientists see how dark matter warps light and curves space across galaxies. Meanwhile, on a mountaintop in northern Chile, the US National Science Foundation and Stanford University researchers are preparing to power up theworld’s largest digital camerainside the Vera C. Rubin Observatory. In the mountains of Uzbekistan, a research team used lasers strapped to a flying robot touncover two cities buried and lost for centuries. The anthropologists said they had mapped these forgotten medieval towns for the first time — located at a key crossroad of ancient silk trade routes — using a drone equipped with LiDAR, or light detection and ranging equipment. When nature reclaims what’s left of once thriving civilizations, scientists are increasingly turning to remote sensing to peer through dense vegetation. The images revealed two large settlements dotted with watchtowers, fortresses, complex buildings, plazas and pathways that tens of thousands of people may have called home. Remember the citizen astronauts who took a SpaceX capsule on a daring ride into a radiation belt and carried out the first private spacewalk in September? Those thrill-seeking explorers, otherwise known as the Polaris Dawn crew, spoke to CNN aboutsome of the uncomfortable medical issuesthey experienced in space — a stark reminder that the human body is not designed for microgravity. Blurred vision, nausea and vomiting were among the symptoms the four-person crew reported. But these issues weren’t unexpected. As part of the mission, the group carried out research that aims to understand and treat space-related ailments. Researchers have long known an 800-year-old tale about a dead man thrown into a well at Sverresborg Castle in Norway.Tossing the body was likely part of an attempt to poison the water supply during a gruesome military raid, the Sverris saga explains. Now, DNA analysis is allowing scientists to corroborate the story in a stunning marriage of history and legend with science and technology. Researchers initially uncovered the bones of a person dubbed “Well-man” near the castle in 1938. But only now, using advanced gene-sequencing technology, has a study team been able to etch out a clearer picture of who the man was — and thefindings revealed an unexpected twist. At least two species of firefly glimmered in the night sky in the Mesozoic Era, according to new research. That means dinosaurs may have witnessed the soft evening glow emitted by the bioluminescent insects. Building on a past analysis of the first firefly species identified from that era, initially described in 2015, a separate team of scientists investigated another99 million-year-old firefly trapped in tree resin. This specimen, found in northern Myanmar in 2016, may help researchers better understand how fireflies evolved the ability to glow at least 100 million years ago. Scientists are only now beginning to glean the evolution of these captivating creatures because their soft bodies are so difficult to preserve in the fossil record. Check out these can’t-miss reads: — A gargantuan meteorite estimated to be four times the size of Mount Evereststruck Earth 3.2 billion years ago.

63,Europe’s secret season for travel starts now,"Summer might be the most popular season for tourism to Europe, but it hardly promises a calm, cool and collected experience. Who can forget this summer’s protests against overtourism inBarcelonaandMallorca, thewildfiresthat raged across Greece during the country’s hottest June and July on record andselfie stoplightsto help control crowds on the clogged streets of Rome and Florence? For travelers looking to avoid all that — as well as break less of a sweat literally and financially — welcome to Europe’s secret season. From roughly mid-October to mid-December, shoulder season for travel to Europe comes with fewer crowds, far more comfortable temperatures in places that skew scorching hot during the summer months and plunging prices on airfare and accommodation. “The cheapest time to fly to Europe is typically from about the middle point of October to the middle point of December,” said Hayley Berg, lead economist at travel platformHopper. “Airfare prices during those eight or nine weeks or so will typically be about an average of 40% lower than prices in the peak of summer in June.” Hopper’s data shows that airfare to Europe from the United States during the period between October 20 and December 8 is averaging between $560 and $630 per ticket — down 9% from this time last year and 5% compared to the same timeframe in 2019. The data also shows that average nightly accommodation rates in the top 10 cities for travel in Europe (including places like Amsterdam, Paris and Munich) drop by 27% in December compared to June, when tourism is at its peak. For Americans not beholden to a family and turkey-centric holiday in the US, even Thanksgiving week can be considered shoulder season for European travel, said Katy Nastro, of travel siteGoing. “Because so many folks are focused on domestic travel due to the Thanksgiving holiday, domestic prices shoot upward,” she said. “But the upside to that is international travel, namely over to Europe, gets downright cheap due to airlines cutting fares in hopes to fill seats.” The in-between period starting the last week in November and into the first two weeks of December is another sweet spot for airfare from the US and accommodation deals in European destinations, Nastro said, citing this period as “the calm before the storm of winter holiday business.” She advised trying to travel before the week of December 16, when prices across the board begin to creep up. Jack Ezon, founder ofEMBARK Beyondtravel agency, said he’s seen a 22% shift recently from clients who traditionally traveled to Europe during the summer months now choosing to visit during the shoulder seasons of spring or fall instead. He attributes this trend to the fact that summers have become unbearably hot in many places, prices are roughly 40% to 50% higher in popular European destinations during the summer and the fact that overtourism has plagued so many places. Among the best spots Ezon points clients toward for autumn travel are Madrid, Barcelona and Ireland — where it’s not too hot or too cold in fall and you can avoid summer’s hordes of road trippers. Another great spot for fall? The principality of Monaco, bordering the French Riviera. “Though the beach clubs in St. Tropez are closed, Monaco is truly an all-year-round destination, with beautiful, mild weather well into December,” Ezon said, adding that the tiny country on the northern coast of the Mediterranean Sea offers shopping, great dining and access to stunning nature within close reach. Madeline Steuber, Virtuoso adviser and co-founder ofSteuber Travel Group, said that being flexible with shoulder season travel can lead to the best prices on luxury accommodations as well as an all-around more fulfilling travel experience. “We encourage a lot of our clients who want to travel in what we call the festive period, which is later December, to consider moving their dates back to the week after Thanksgiving through the first two weeks of December,” she said. “We can get premium guides, premium drivers and excellent hotels at just lower price points for the same product than what they would pay for those in the summer,” she said. Steuber points to river cruising in Europe as a good fall option for covering a lot of ground with food and beverage expenditures included. The week after Thanksgiving through the first two weeks of December is the best time to get deals on river cruises, she said. And it’s a bonus that many river cruises along the Danube, Main and Rhine rivers visit Christmas markets at this time of year, too. “Any traveler who has wanted to take advantage of European Christmas markets but suffers from a lack of PTO may be in luck this year,” said Nastro. “Because Thanksgiving is the last week of November this year, you can squeeze in a winter holiday trip over the Thanksgiving week.” One of Germany’s famous Christmas markets opens on November 29 inNuremberg, and France’s belovedStrasbourgChristmas market opens November 27, which means you could be sipping mulled wine and snacking on gingerbread while everyone back home is busy gobbling turkey and stuffing, she said. London, Paris and Rome remain the most searched European destinations for travel regardless of the time of year — including those end-of-year trips between mid-October and mid-December, said Berg. But more off-the-beaten path destinations in Europe that are showing an uptick in demand (including for searches at this time of year) include Marseille in Southern France, Cyprus, Denmark’s Faroe Islands, Longyearbyen in Norway’s Svalbard archipelago and Helsinki, according to Hopper data. All also offer lower prices on airfare from the US for end-of-year travel this year compared to the same periods last year and in 2019. Mediterranean cities in the south of France, Greece and Cyprus stay temperate into November and December and Northern European destinations including the Faroe Islands, Finland and Norway offer the chance to see the Northern Lights. “There’s definitely a trend among younger travelers toward many of these destinations,” said Berg. “Those domestic travelers from a few years ago who went to Jackson Hole are now headed to the Arctic Circle.” Booking.com’s recentrevealof 2025’s trending destinations also showed growing interest in unique cities in Europe such as Trieste, Italy; Tignes, France; and Villajoyosa, Spain. The site found that nearly two-thirds (61%) of Americans plan to travel in the off season in the coming year to lower the overall cost of their trips, according to Ben Harrell, managing director, US at Booking.com. Nastro said that while the Croatian coast and Kotor in Montenegro get packed with sun-seekers during the summertime, the shoulder season in these places offers a coziness that’s appealing, too. “Cultural festivals, homemade pumpkin seed oil, and gorgeous and almost tourist-free views should be considered,” she said. But she advises travelers to “stick to the bigger cities as some smaller seaside towns may be closed for the season.” And while Tuscany booms during the toasty summer months, November and December usher in crisp weather and white truffle season. Hotels like the 18th centuryBorgo San Vincenzoin Montepulciano can arrange truffle hunts and visits to local truffle markets, and aChristmas marketeven takes over the town’s Piazza Grande starting in mid-November. If you decide to break from the pack and head to Europe instead of a domestic destination, flying on Thanksgiving Day offers the added benefit of being the least crowded day at US airports during the holiday crush. And it’s best to avoid the jampacked Sunday after the holiday. Along with airfare, average nightly accommodation rates drop dramatically across Europe at the end of the year compared to during the peak summer months. Hopper’s data shows average nightly rates in cities like Paris and Reykjavik down 30% and more at the end of the year compared to peak summer. In Rome, the savings on nightly rates soars to 40% at the end of the year, with average room rates clocking in at $200 per night. That means a hotel you might have always dreamed of experiencing might suddenly be within reach. “Finding availability at certain European gems can be nearly impossible in the summer without early planning, but some of our favorite places still have availability for Thanksgiving,” saidForaadviser Kim Hannum. Among those luxury properties are Adare Manor in Limerick, Ireland; J.K. Place Roma in Italy; and Grand Hotel Son Net in Mallorca, Spain. An online search for rooms atAdare Manorshows rates of $814 for two people with breakfast on November 28, 2024, while a similar room on June 29, 2025, costs nearly double that at $1,524. At Mallorca’sGrand Hotel Son Net, a room on Thanksgiving night this year is 515 euros (around $560) while the same room on June 19, 2025 (when a two-night minimum is required due to peak season) costs 1,075 euros (around $1,168). And even if you can’t make a secret-season trip to Europe happen before the winter holidays are upon us, Berg said to mark your calendar and set price alerts for Travel Deal Tuesday — the travel equivalent of Black Friday. Those deals drop on December 3 this year. “The Tuesday after Thanksgiving is probably the single best day of the year to book a trip to Europe or anywhere international,” she said. “We see deep discounts on airfare deals and on hotel stays across the travel industry, and then obviously on the Hopper app as well.” Even though traveling to Europe in January or February is likely to bring even cooler temperatures, you can reap many of the same benefits of the fall lull, including lower prices and fewer crowds, she said. “There’s much more of a focus on tourism in summer,” Berg said. “Whereas during this period you’re having a much more local experience, which is what a lot of travelers are craving.” Florida-based travel writerTerry Wardlives in Tampa and is crossing fingers and toes for enough snow during an early-December ski trip to theMontana Lodge & Spain Italy’s Aosta Valley.",Not Found
64,He served with the US Army in Iraq. Now he’s one of Asia’s top chefs and a Netflix ‘Culinary Class Wars’ judge,"From a warzone in Iraq to a Michelin-starred kitchen and a hit Netflix show, chef Sung Anh’s path to the top of Asia’s fine dining scene has been anything but ordinary. “Just like I did in the US Army, where I volunteered to go to the war, wanting to do something different — I decided to come here to Korea to try something different,” says the Korean-American chef and judge on hit reality cooking show “Culinary Class Wars,” which has just been green-lit for a second season. Sung, 42, is the head chef and owner of South Korea’s only three-Michelin-starred restaurant,Mosu Seoul. In recent weeks, he has gained a new legion of fans as the meticulous and straight-talking judge on the new Netflix series. It’s this passion and unwavering drive to forge his own path that’s helped reshape fine dining in his birth home. Born in Seoul, South Korea’s capital, Sung and his family emigrated to San Diego, California when he was 13. “We were just a family from Korea, seeking the American Dream,” he says. “As an immigrant family, we didn’t really know English.” As a teen growing up on the US West Coast, his mind couldn’t have been further from cooking. “I went to school, got into college, but decided to join the US Army because that’s the only way I thought I could travel,” says the chef. Over four years of service, he trained in bases across the country, before being deployed to his country of birth, South Korea and — following 9/11 — to the Middle East. “When I volunteered to go to Iraq during the war, people asked me, ‘Why did you do such a crazy thing?’” he recounts. “I heard all these stories from my grandfather, my father, uncles and family friends about the Korean War and the Vietnam War. I volunteered to go to Iraq because… I thought I had this one chance to go to war and experience it.” In late 2002, he was deployed to Baghdad for a year-long tour as a specialist with an artillery unit, “clearing out bombs and weapons” from Iraqi forces, including the bunker whereSaddam Hussein was found in 2003. Sung describes his time in the army as “eye-opening.” “Being a soldier for four years was one of the greatest times in my life, it’s one of the most exciting,” he says. “There were people from Dakota, Idaho, Puerto Rico, Hawaii. I learned about their cultures and subcultures within the country.” After his service, Sung wanted to shift gears — literally. A petrolhead who loved racing cars under the cover of darkness as a teenager, his dream was to become a mechanic for Porsche. But two weeks before he was set to begin his training, a chance encounter with a group of chefs outside the now-closed American branch of famed cooking school Le Cordon Bleu in California changed the course of his life again. “They were all in white shirts and checkered pants. I had no idea what the school was,” he recalls. After speaking with the chefs and a rather influential school counselor, Sung was “hooked” and decided to put his mechanic dreams on hold. “I didn’t ever look back, I never regretted it. And now I drive a Porsche, so it’s okay,” he says with a laugh. “I think it was very spontaneous for me to choose this profession,” he admits. However, cooking was always in his blood. As a child, Sung was raised on his grandmother’s food. And in the US, he got his first taste of being in the kitchen helping out at his family’s Chinese restaurant after school. After culinary school, he worked in some of the West Coast’s finest kitchens, from the Michelin-star draped French Laundry to Benu and Urasawa. “I’ve met some of the greatest chefs in the US. They’ve mentored me and I think they’ve refined the roughness that I had from the military,” he says, crediting them with teaching him about the importance of finesse in their profession. In 2015, Sung opened his own restaurant, Mosu San Francisco, combining American flavors with nods to his Korean heritage. It was a risk that paid off – within a year he was awarded his first Michelin star. “It didn’t satisfy me that much. I was very, very happy for my team, for myself. But I knew there’s more to do,” he says. “I wanted to come back to my country and utilize what I know and what I understand… use the indigenous ingredients, the Korean culture, the heritage.” So, after two decades in the US and a Michelin star to his name, it was time to bring Mosu home. In 2017, chef Sung opened Mosu Seoul in the heart of one of the world’s fastest-growing fine dining scenes. Here, his plan was simple: to innovate. Mosu was unlike anything Seoul had seen before. Sung took what he had created in San Francisco with fusion gastronomy and transformed the menu to celebrate Korean ingredients. But this was no ordinary Korean fare. The Korean-American chef prides himself on doing things differently — not being bound by one particular style of cooking or cuisine. He melds his culinary inspiration from his heritage and cross-culture upbringing, all with meticulous detail. The result? Thoughtful and playful courses, such as Mosu’s signature abalone taco, which features subtle nods to flavors from both his home and memories of California. “At Mosu, I cook what I think is the best, no boundaries, no genre,” he says. In 2022, Mosu Seoul was awarded three Michelin stars, and with it, the recognition of being the modern face of the South Korean capital’s transforming gastronomic scene. Sung’s meticulous attention to detail is on full display on Netflix’s hit reality cooking show “Culinary Class Wars,” where 20 elite chefs go head-to-head with 80 unknown cooks for the title of South Korea’s top chef. Chef Sung stars alongside veteran restaurateur Paik Jong-won as the much revered — and at times feared — judges on the show, demanding only the best from the incredible roster of chefs. The master technician known for his high standards – he makes even the top chefs sweat when tasting their dishes — admits he’s a little “uncomfortable” with his new-found fame. But Sung says he stayed true to himself on camera. “When I speak my mind, I speak accurately, logically and carefully, because they rely on what I say,” he says. “I wasn’t acting, I was just being me. I gave a lot of respect to the contestants for their courage. I know how difficult it is to make good food. I wanted to support them, but not everyone’s going to win. So I set my standards.” The show has put a spotlight on the growing strength and diversity of South Korean fine dining, which has been largely overlooked in global culinary circles until recently. “Korea’s fine dining and restaurant scene has grown so rapidly,” he says. “Seoul was once a layover city, now it is a destination.” In early 2024, four Seoul restaurants — including Mosu — made it to the list ofAsia’s 50 Best Restaurants, including Mingles, Onjium and the fermentation specialist 7th Door. Chef Sung was also honored at this year’s Asia’s 50 Best Restaurants ceremony — the first time it was held in Seoul — for pioneering a new wave of Korean fusion cuisine with the Chefs’ Choice Award. The growth of Korean fine dining comes at a time when all eyes are on Korean chefs across the globe, from Komah in Sao Paulo to Atomix in New York. Two of the dozen Michelin stars awarded in New York in 2023 went to Korean restaurants. “Everyone around the world is fascinated by Korean culture, food, fine dining,” Sung says. “I think they’re really interested in what we’re doing, what the flavor profile is and how we represent this culture through food.” And for Sung, that means sharing his food with the world, too. In 2022, the chef opened a sister restaurant, Mosu Hong Kong, in contemporary art gallery M+ in the city’s burgeoning cultural district. As recognition grows for South Korean food, chef Sung takes things further at Mosu Seoul, celebrating more than just local ingredients. For instance, all the plates and bowls used at his restaurant are made by Korean artisans. “I wanted to put my food on a plate that matches my food, not just something that’s really beautiful, expensive or shiny,” he says. Sung sources all of Mosu’s tableware from specialist craft storeSikijang, in Seoul’s upscale Gangnam district. “I’ve worked with a lot of chefs, but chef Sung is different, he is quite special,” says Sikijang owner and creative director Chung So-yeong. “He can read different artists’ techniques and materials in crafts — it’s very impressive.” One of Mosu Seoul’s signature serving dishes — a pristine white porcelain plate — is made by a Seoul-based artist renowned for his elaborate and twisted porcelain sculptures. Ceramicist Yoon Sol had never made tableware until he was introduced to the chef in 2017. He was quickly inspired by chef Sung’s vision. “There are people who share the same thoughts, feelings and emotions as yourself, and you get goosebumps when you meet them,” says Yoon from his studio in the outskirts of Seoul. “Chef Sung gives life and character to each dish I make, which I find very respectable. I really think highly of his mindset and how he values beauty.” The pristine white of the ceramicist’s tableware makes chef Sung’s culinary creations pop. “I have a really good relationship with the artist,” Sung says. “I try to kind of put their intention and their work into the food and then show it off as one.” In early 2024, Mosu Seoul closed the doors on its original Itaewon location after seven years - relocating to a new home within the same district. The new-look Mosu is set to open in early 2025. As the new location undergoes its “Mosu” fit-out, the team has been busy developing the menu and hosting events across Asia. Chef Sung says the new space will “retain the DNA” of the original Mosu Seoul. But he plans to “bring it up a notch,” adding new dishes and a new look to the décor, ensuring Mosu Seoul continues to evolve and grow, just like South Korea’s fine dining scene.",Not Found
65,The Full English: How a greasy feast came to define and divide a nation,"Picture something extremely British. Now double it. Did you imagine the Beatles, striding across Abbey Road — the twist being that their classic album cover is rendered in the contents of a full English breakfast? In 2012, food artist Paul Bakercooked up this exact scene. John is the (scrambled) eggman, while vegetarian Paul is tastefully made out of mushrooms. Abbey Road is re-surfaced in baked beans, a bacon Volkswagen Beetle pulled up on the side. Slabs of white and brown toast form the marked crosswalk. In one fell swoop of edible absurdism, Baker’s artwork demonstrates the cultural heft of the full English breakfast. Devoured in the nation’s “greasy spoon” cafes and motorway stop-offs — not to mention some of its ritziest hotels and restaurants — this gut-busting symphony of bacon, eggs, sausage and various other cooked ingredients (invariably sluiced down with a steaming cup of tea or coffee) has become shorthand for Britishness. It is as big as the Beatles, bigger. Like “Abbey Road” itself, the full English — or “fry-up” or “full monty” or “cooked breakfast” — is both revered as a thing of godlike genius, and has its sour-faced critics; those who claim it is too chaotic, too self-indulgent for its own good. So where did the full English originate? How did it come to define a nation? And come to think of it, what exactlyisit? Historically, English breakfasts were a modest affair. For Britain’s Roman invaders, it was the least important meal of the day. Its medieval Norman conquerors were happy starting the morning with a hunk of bread and a slurp of weak ale. It’s true that meat was sometimes eaten first thing (in 1662, diarist Samuel Pepys recorded “a breakfast of cold roast beef”) but the genesis of the fry-up wasn’t really sparked until the Victorians came along. As Kaori O’Connor writes in“The English Breakfast,” “Large breakfasts do not figure in English life or cookbooks until the nineteenth century, when they appear with dramatic suddenness.” It was in the grand houses on country estates that these languorous, buffet-style breakfasts made their debut — the kind depicted in shows like the Edwardian-era “Downton Abbey”, where diners help themselves to hot viands piled high in silver chafing dishes. Aristocratic socialite and writer Lady Cynthia Asquith recalled breakfasts with “crisp, curly bacon, eggs (poached, boiled and fried), mounds of damp kedgeree (made with salmon), haddocks swimming in melted butter, sputtering sausages and ruddily exuding kidneys.” As well as being an indulgent display of wealth, writes O’Connor, the English breakfast was a robustly patriotic retort to thehors d’oeuvres-loving French: “There were no such things as a French breakfast… So breakfast time became the bastion of Englishness, and breakfast emerged as the national meal.” The middle classes soon cottoned on, encouraged by celebrity cook and domestic goddess Isabella Beeton. In 1861 Beeton published her “Book of Household Management,” which featured recipes for breakfast dishes including “fried ham and eggs” and “broiled rashers of bacon.” A trend soon emerged in the publishing world: “The Breakfast Book” (1865), “Handbook for the Breakfast Table” (1873), “Breakfast and Luncheon at Home” (1880), “Breakfast Dishes for Every Morning of Three Months” (1884). In 1874, the Edinburgh Evening News wrote of “An English Farmer’s Breakfast,” consisting of rashers of bacon “bubbling with grease and laid on thick slices of bread.” Other publications from the time carried ads for bacon and sausages. “For first-class breakfast bacon,” ran an ad inThe Blyth Timesin 1890, “try Thompson’s English rolled flitch.” By 1921, a Lady Jekyll was telling readers of The London Times that “no breakfast table is complete without eggs and bacon.” It’s easier said than done to spell out what a full English is. While various components (fish, marmalade, kidneys) gradually fell by the wayside, others were tacked on. Heinz beans — canned haricot beans in tomato sauce considered by many now to be an integral element of the fry-up — arrived in 1886, when the young entrepreneur Henry Heinzsold five casesto London department store Fortnum & Mason: “I think, Mr Heinz, we’ll take the lot!” HP Sauce— a spicy brown ooze, its bottle emblazoned with the Houses of Parliament — registered its name in 1895, and has smothered sausages the length and breadth of the country ever since. The many nuances of the full English are best appreciated by gazing into the window of any given greasy spoon, where you’ll be greeted with variations along the lines of: “Set 1: Egg, Bacon, Beans, Sausage, 2 Toast, Tea or Coffee “Set 2: Egg, Tomato, Sausage, Mushroom, 2 Toast, Tea or Coffee “Set 3: Egg, Bacon, Tomato, Sausage, Mushroom, Toast, Chips, Tea or Coffee…” On and on it goes, like the workings of some brainiactrying to break a calorific Enigma code. The mapping of a fry-up becomes all the more convoluted when you take into account its Celtic cousins, the full Scottish (with the addition ofhaggis, and traditional sausages switched out for square Lorne sausage); the full Irish or Ulster fry (often featuring soda bread and white, rather than black, pudding); and the full Welsh (where leftfield laverbread and fresh cockles get a place at the table). Even more confusingly, despite being called a fry-up, these days the ingredients are not necessarily fried. At least some aspects of the breakfast are easier to pigeonhole. Sausage, bacon and egg are usually a given, as is some form of bread with which to mop up the residue. Black pudding (aka blood pudding, a favorite of the late Anthony Bourdain), mushrooms, tomatoes (fresh or tinned) and chips regularly feature, but tend to be the diner’s choice. Every Brit has their own dream team of ingredients, their own thoughts on each ingredient realizing its full potential. Eggs might be fried, poached or scrambled. Bacon smoked or unsmoked. Bread could be fried, toasted, or left as is. A dollop of tomato ketchup or brown sauce may or may not adorn the side of the plate. In the sitcom “I’m Alan Partridge,” the eponymous local radio host provides a pompous postmortem on his Ukrainian girlfriend’s stab at a cooked breakfast: “Bacon, 10 on 10. Button mushrooms, bingo. Black pudding, snap. Minor criticism — more distance between the eggs and the beans. I may want to mix them but I want that to be my decision. Use the sausage as a breakwater. But I’m nitpicking. On the whole a very good effort. Seven on 10. Let’s make love.” Some ingredients should be disqualified altogether, argues Guise Bule from theEnglish Breakfast Society, a group of volunteers who celebrate the history and tradition of the English breakfast. “Reconstituted potato hash browns are a lazy replacement forbubble and squeak,” he announces, with the air of scientific fact. Onion rings are another component that have elbowed their way onto British breakfast plates in recent times, in a move that many traditionalists consider sacrilege. One thing most fry-up lovers can agree on is that the breakfast should be heavy on the stomach, light on the wallet; something “Kitchen Nightmares” chef Gordon Ramsay is now painfully aware of since dinerschided himfor charging £19, or nearly $25, for what they perceived to be a particularly stingy spread. Such accusations cannot be leveled at theDalby Cafe in Margate, Kent, which went viral after local rock star Pete Dohertydemolished its infamous “mega breakfast” in under 20 minutes, earning himself a placeon the coveted wall of fame. And you thought biting the head off a bat was rock ‘n’ roll. Like most English inventions — the flush toilet, the iron bridge,the hovercraft— the fry-up has not always enjoyed an easy ride. World War II brought severe food rationing, a broadside that took the fry-up years to recover from. Nonetheless, as mass-processed foods like sausages, battery-farmed eggs and sliced bread rocketed in the 1950s, the English breakfast became a national obsession. Any cafe or hotel worth its salt cooked one. Brits visiting the Spanish package vacation resorts of Benidorm and Majorca demanded eggs and bacon served beachside. In 1953, when thieves broke into a west London secondary school, they made time to fry themselves a few eggs and brew a pot of tea. But in today’s age of kale smoothies and overnight oats, the iconic breakfast faces a fresh reckoning. “To eat well in England,” the playwright Somerset Maugham once said, “you should eat breakfast three times a day.” Yet recent research shows younger Britons are eating just two or three fry-ups a year. In an acutely health (and time) conscious society,someare beginning to ask if the full English is dying out. If that is the case then British society is making a good job of hiding it. TV broadcasts constant reruns of “Four in a Bed,” a low-budget reality show in which bed-and-breakfast owners judge each other on the freshness of their duvets and the standard of their English breakfasts. Seaside resorts hawk miniature English breakfasts inhard candy form. On most high streets in the country you’ll find a branch of low-cost pub chain Wetherspoon slinging bacon, sausage and egg foras little as £2.99a pop. At the other end of the restaurant spectrum, where Gordon Ramsay flubbed his lines, others have got the memo. The Hawksmoor restaurant chain recently reinstatedits redoutable take on an English breakfastfollowing public outcry when it was briefly paused. “We’ve never been so inundated by requests to bring something back,” explains Huw Gott, one of Hawksmoor’s co-founders. Every Saturday, Hawksmoor branches in London, Edinburgh and Liverpool pile up 50-80 plates with sugar-pit bacon chop, Victorian-style sausages, Moira black pudding, hash browns, grilled bone marrow, trotter baked beans, fried eggs, grilled mushrooms, roasted tomatoes, unlimited toast, and HP Sauce gravy. “Warning,” runs the breakfast’s tagline, “Not for the faint-hearted.” Far from simply being a ritzy take on Dalby Cafe’s angina-inducing food challenge, Hawkmoor’s breakfast is a paean to the early days of the hearty English breakfast. “We use a recipe from the Victoria era for our sausages made with pork, beef and mutton with plenty of herbs and spices,” says Gott. Elsewhere, the English breakfast continues to evolve, just as it always has. In April 2024, home appliance manufacturer Breville opened a“Grease-Less Spoon” pop-up, showing how ingredients could be cooked more healthily in an air fryer. Veggie and vegan options now appear on many breakfast menus. A brand established by Paul McCartney’s late wife, Linda, does a roaring trade inmeat-free sausages, many of them ending up at the breakfast table. Something else hints at the fry-up’s immortality; who’s ordering it. “We have people from all over the world coming along hunting out a perfect British breakfast,” says Hawksmoor’s Huw Gott. Social media has ratcheted up this appreciation a notch or two. On TikTok,Francophile twistsare attempted on this most British of breakfasts. American food presenter Adam Richman of “Man Vs Food” fame recently traveled toBury Marketin the north of England to savor lumps of Chadwick’s famed black pudding. The English breakfast was created as a statement piece, and in many ways it remains just that. A meaty calling card for Brits. A delicious tourist attraction. Something for foreigners to gawk at, sometimesbungle horrendouslywhen they have a go at it themselves — but ultimately, relish and applaud. So long as there’s tourism in Britain, you can be sure the fry-up will follow. Just as, while there are Brits vacationing in Benidorm, the scent of sizzling bacon will continue to waft along the esplanade.",Global
66,‘I want to be here for the rest of my life’: Why this man swapped San Francisco for Colombia,"After spending several years building a life he loved in San Francisco, Jason Bennett, originally from the Bay Area, had every intention of remaining in the Californian city for good. The senior marketing executive, who previously worked for Gap Inc., says his main goal was “to continue climbing the corporate ladder” and he couldn’t really envision being anywhere else. But in 2018, Bennett packed up and moved to the South American country of Colombia permanently after “falling hard” for Medellín, once one of the most notorious cities in the world. He now works for himself, running two companies, from his “adopted home.” “Life surprises you,” Bennett tells CNN Travel. So how did he end up ditching the US and moving to a destination he hadn’t even visited until two years earlier? Bennett, who first moved to San Francisco in 2006, explains that he had begun to feel disconnected from his job, as well as the city, and questioned whether he really wanted to spend the rest of his life “in an office working for other people.” “I wouldn’t quite call it an existential crisis, if you will, but I was getting a lot less fulfillment out of what was in my bank account,” he says. “And I was getting very frustrated with San Francisco, and these things were not adding up anymore.” After almost a decade in the city, Bennett, who says he’d been “saving religiously” for years, had been able to travel to far-flung destinations such as Lebanon, India, Estonia and Argentina to see music artists with his friends, and his perspective on life was shifting. “I was feeling just optimism and positivity in the air in these cities, that I found, frankly, missing when I would go back,” he says. “And it started to create that kind of trigger and thought in my mind, ‘Maybe there’s something else out there.” Feeling disillusioned by the life he’d thought he wanted, Bennett resigned from his job and started up his own marketing company,True Star Consulting, in 2015. “You’ve got to jump sometime in life to know if you can do it or not,” he says. Bennett also decided to take a break from the US and spend a few months traveling the world, while working remotely. Later that year, he visited Lisbon, Portugal, before moving on to Cartagena, Colombia. “I knew after a week that I would never return to my old life,” he admits. “But I didn’t think I would ever permanently settle somewhere else.” While he wasn’t that enthralled by Cartagena, Bennett felt something change inside him in April 2016 when he arrived in Medellín, nicknamed the City of the Eternal Spring. “There was an energy I had never felt before,” he says. “The food and weather were awesome, the metro astoundingly pristine.” He planned another visit, and found that he experienced the same surge of energy when he returned in 2018. “But above all, I was especially taken and inspired by the happy and friendly people, who I found completely remarkable given what they had gone through.” Leaving Medellín to continue his travels, Bennett was hit with an overwhelming sense of sadness and longing. “It was then that I started to say, ‘Do you really need to leave?’” Bennett says. At the same time, he realized that he was mostly returning to San Francisco because he felt that was what was expected of him. “Well I don’t want to do that anymore,” he thought to himself. “And my happiness levels are off the charts when I’m in Medellín.” Bennett ultimately decided to “cut ties” with his life in San Francisco, and went on to sell his one-bedroom apartment there, and buy a two-bedroom property in the neighborhood of Castropol in Medellín’s El Poblado district. “As luck, or karma, would have it, I accepted an offer on my San Francisco apartment the very same weekend my offer was accepted on my Medellín apartment,” he says, before explaining that he subsequently had “a 45-day clock to unwind” his life in the US. According to Bennett, his new apartment was “roughly 80% cheaper per square foot” than his Californian abode at that time. After selling his furniture, shipping over some of his possessions to Colombia via Miami and filling two suitcases with clothes, some artifacts and his beloved coffee maker, Bennett set off to begin his new life in January 2018. “I really remember turning and locking that door,” he recalls. “And emotionally, I was done. There was no lingering. Like, ‘Is this the right thing to do?’” Bennett says he immediately felt at home in Medellín, recalling how the “warmth and kindness” of its people pulled him in. “I always have felt a draw to the Colombian people,” he says. “And specifically those from Medellín. For anyone who’s not been here, the warmth and kindness is off the charts.” Bennett says he was particularly impressed by the lengths locals were prepared to go to help others. “It’s that much more remarkable given that this city, 20 or 30 years ago, was so feared by so many,” he says, reflecting on Medellín’s controversial past. The city, the second largest in Colombia, was once home to the Medellín Cartel which, led by drug lord Pablo Escobar, terrorized the country for decades. As a result, Medellín was synonymous with cocaine and murder up until the early 2000s. “That they have chosen to create a culture and a community of love, respect and connectivity, rather than one of hate, divisiveness and anger,” adds Bennett. Although Colombia has a long association with drugs and gangs, the country’s murder rate dropped by 82% from 1993 to 2018, andcrime rates in Medellínhave lowered significantly over the years. “I feel safer here than they do in America, without question,” says Bennett. According to Bennett, one of the best things about living in Medellín is the quality of life. “The drinking water is phenomenal,” he says. “We have our own reservoir system… The food is incredible. We can grow anything all the time. The fresh fruits. It’s such a healthy lifestyle. “The coffee level, of course, is out of control. And the amount of parks, I can take you to 10 different parks that I love.” He’s also full of praise for the country’s health care system – the World Health Organization ranked Colombia at number 22 inan analysis of 191 countries– describing it as “phenomenal.” “Healthcare is a constitutional right here,” he says. “And there is a public system that is available to everyone.” Bennett, who pays around $2,000 a year for a private medical plan, says he’s been able to build a personal relationship with his doctors in Medellín. “I have had access to the best medicalists that I have ever had in my entire life,” he says. “Not that my doctors in the United States were not good, but (here) I sit with my doctor for an hour. We talk about life. “You feel like you’re just a number and you’re rushed in and out in the United States.” Bennett is also a big fan of the city’s metro system, a network of trains, cable cars, trams and buses, which first opened in 1995 and is now one of the most successful in the world. “They started building this network during the worst of the violence, and it came to be seen as a symbol of hope for the city,” he says. “So it is the cleanest, most respected metro that you will ever come across in your life, except for maybe Japan.” Although he clearly loves being in Medellín, there are some aspects of life in the US that he misses. For Bennett, the “level of directness” of the people is probably top of the list. “The (Colombian) culture is so kind, they don’t really like to say, ‘No,’” he says. “So you ask questions, and you often don’t get a straight answer. “You’re like, ‘Come on. You can just tell me how it is. I’m not going to get mad at you.’” He goes on to explain that he finds Colombians to be more relaxed in general, and “people don’t really act with the sense of urgency that you might get in America. “I do miss that,” he admits. “But on the whole, I’m around much happier people. So I feel that it’s a worthy trade off.” Bennett notes that it can take a little while for newcomers to figure out how to get important services like bank accounts and energy services set up in the country. “It takes time,” he notes. “It’s not as quick as in America. It’s not as quick as what you might be used to. There are steps you need to take, and you have to be persistent.” When it comes to affordability, while Bennett points out that “inflation has raised prices on quite a few things compared to what they once were,” he still finds Medellín to be incredibly good value. “Excellent meals can be had for under $10, Uber is not expensive, and the world’s best coffee is less than $2 a cup,” he adds. After six years, Bennett is fully immersed in the Medellín experience and the city feels very much like home. He’s not quite fluent in Spanish yet, but after studying the language for five years, Bennett says his confidence is growing and he’s able to hold conversations reasonably comfortably. “It’s my duty as a guest to learn the language,” he says. “That’s the thing that kind of kills me about some expats, is that they don’t learn any Spanish.” Although he does have some friends in the city who are fellow Americans, Bennett says he tries to avoid hanging with “expat groups,” preferring to spend time with locals. In 2022, Bennett launched a tourism company, The Vegan Paisa, now know asThe Paisa Plan, with the aim of helping others discover the “magic of Medellín.” “The name was inspired by the moniker (Paisa) for those born in Medellín,” he adds. Bennett currently has a residency visa, which he renews every five years, but plans to apply for Colombian citizenship in the future. “I want to be here for the rest of my life. It’s a reflection of who I am now,” he says. “The values that Medellin stands for are the same values that I stand for.” However, he goes on to stress that he has no plans to renounce his US citizenship. “I happily pay taxes to the US State government,” he says. “And I don’t ever want to come across as like I’m shading San Francisco or the United States in general. “But I do sense a profound energy shift when I go back to visit my family and I look at a country with abundance and with resources that are the dream of so many. “And (think) how did it devolve into constant fighting, election conspiracies, healthcare not being a right, women’s rights being taken away, guns everywhere? “They just broke every contract that you as a citizen expect of your country.” Bennett last returned to the US this May. Both of his parents have traveled over to Colombia to visit him, along with his sister Jen, over the past few years. “One of the nicest things my mom said was how she felt safe in crowds for the first time in long while,” says Bennett. While he hasn’t been able to explore much of the rest of the country, aside from visits to Bogota, Cali and Cartagena, he hopes to rectify this soon. “I have a lot more of the country that I want to see, for sure,” he adds, admitting that he misses Colombia whenever he travels elsewhere. Bennett acknowledges that many of the decisions that he’s made with regards to his career and the destination he lives in have been easier due to the fact that he’s single with no dependents. “I’ve never wanted to get married,” he says. “I don’t have kids. My time is my time. I realize that that is not the reality for a lot of people. “I’ve crafted my life that way… I decided that I wanted to have that freedom of time and location and all of that.” He advises those who are thinking of making a similar move to spend some time working towards it and coming up with a strategy. “You’ve got to have a long term plan,” he says. Since choosing to relocate to Colombia,﻿Bennett has noticed a considerable change in his overall wellbeing and says he couldn’t be happier with how things have turned out. “As I’ve gone into my 40s, it’s lowered my stress levels immensely,” says Bennett. “I can just get around that energy and vibe and kind of soak it in. It puts me in much better health, physically and mentally, as I continue to call Medellín home.”",Not Found
67,Three Washington Post editorial board members step down amid wave of canceled subscriptions over non-endorsement,"The ripple effect of Jeff Bezos’s decision to block The Washington Post from endorsing a presidential candidate continues to reverberate through the newspaper, as a tidal wave of readers cancel their subscriptions and nearly one-third of the Post’s editorial board step down in protest. The resignations came Monday as David Shipley, the Post’s editorial page editor, met with staffers in the opinion section, telling them that Bezos, the newspaper’s owner, first expressed doubts in September about endorsing in this year’s presidential election. A person with knowledge of the matter told CNN that an endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harrishad been draftedby the Post’s editorial board members before it was quashed by Bezos. But a final decision on the endorsement was not made until last week, according to a person with knowledge of the meeting. Shipley said he tried to convince Bezos to agree to make the endorsement, but “I failed,” he told staffers, according to the person. Attendees asked about reports that hundreds of thousands of Post readers had canceled their subscriptions since the decision wasannounced Friday, but Shipley said he did not know the figures, the person said. On Monday,NPR reportedthat by midday more than 200,000 people had canceled their digital subscriptions to the Post, citing two people familiar with the matter. CNN could not independently confirm the figure. A Washington Post spokesperson declined to comment. Staffers also asked Shipley about former President Donald Trump’smeeting on Fridaywith executives from Blue Origin, the same day the Post announced it would not endorse in the race. Shipley said Bezos told him he did not know executives from his company were scheduled to meet with Trump. A person close to Bezos later confirmed to CNN that he did not know about the Blue Origin meeting in advance. But in the wake of Bezos’s decision not to endorse, many Post staffers have been left with unanswered questions and a sense of bewilderment over the reasoning behind the move. “There’s just this huge amount of feeling that what we do has been set back by this sort of giant hit on our trust, and trust is what journalism is about,” the person said. Two Post journalists, Molly Roberts and David E. Hoffman both announced Monday they had stepped down from their positions on the editorial board, although both will stay at the paper. A third journalist, Mili Mitra also stepped down,the Post reported, meaning nearly one-third of the 10-member board had resigned. Hoffman, who was awarded the 2024 Pulitzer Prize in Editorial Writing for a series on the new tactics authoritarian regimes use to repress dissent, told CNN in an interview he did not want to remain silent about the threat Trump poses to the country. “I cannot sit here any longer on the editorial board and write those editorials while we ourselves have given in to silence,” he said. “We face a terrible, terrible choice, I believe, a looming autocracy. I don’t want to be silent about it. I don’t want the Post to be silent about it, and the fact that we’re not going to endorse is a degree of silence I can’t stand.” In her resignationletter, Roberts said she was resigning “because the imperative to endorse Kamala Harris over Donald Trump is as morally clear as it gets. Worse, our silence is exactly what Donald Trump wants: for the media, for us, to keep quiet.” Robert Kagan, a Post columnist and opinion editor-at-large who had been with the paper for 25 years, also resigned Friday as a direct result of the non-endorsement. “This is obviously an effort by Jeff Bezos to curry favor with Donald Trump in the anticipation of his possible victory,” Kagan told CNN’s Erin Burnett OutFront. “Trump has threatened to go after Bezos’ business. Bezos runs one of the largest companies in America. They have tremendously intricate relations with federal government. They depend on the federal government.” Former Post executive editor Marty Baron, who led the paper under Bezos during the first Trump administration,called the decisionnot to endorse an act of “cowardice.” “To declare a moment of high principle, only 11 days before the election that is just highly suspect that is just not to be believed that this was a matter of principle at this point,” Baron told CNN’s Michael Smerconish on Saturday morning.

68,What the rising popularity of Yemeni coffee shops says about third places,"The most popular spot on a late Friday night in a pocket of Manhattan’s West Village isn’t a trendy bar or a Michelin-starred restaurant but a Yemeni coffee house chain strictly serving coffee, tea and pastries. A step into Qahwah House on Carmine Street offers a rich whiff of cardamom, Arabic music and crowds of people both at tables and in line to order. The energy spills over into the sidewalk, where some begin performing a Levantine folk dance known as dabke. It’s a snapshot of various Eastern cultures; Arabic, Farsi and Urdu fill the air, and some customers don traditional attire. Qahwah House is just one of a string of Yemeni coffee chains that originated in the Arab-populated Detroit area and are rapidly springing up across the country, often where there are significant Middle Eastern and Muslim populations. Nineteen Qahwah House locations are open across seven states, with more under construction and expected to open this year. Another chain, Haraz, opened this month in the pricey SoHo neighborhood in Manhattan, with at least six more in the region planned in the next two years. Times Square will be home to two other chains, MOKAFÉ and Qamaria Yemeni Coffee Co. The rapid expansion of these shops underscores the demand for late-night social spots for not only young Muslims and Middle Easterners, but also younger people who are looking for a non-digital third space where they can hang out without alcohol or having to yell over loud music. They don’t have many other options.Malls, a traditional third place for young people, are growing more and more unpopular. Chains like Starbucks have becomemore like take-out counters.Alcohol-free lifestylesare growing even for those outside of the Muslim faith, which many practicing the religion already take part in. So for many young people in urban areas, especially those from immigrant communities looking for a way to connect to their cultures, it’s a great option. In New York “people like to go out clubbing,” Bhavishya Banda, a strategy consultant, said one late night at Qahwah House. “Personally, I don’t find enjoyment in that. But I want to go out at night.” Third spaces are not a new concept.Sober bars popping up across the countryaim to build a sense of community and social connections. But Yemeni coffee houses have taken up both those trends and boomed. Younger people, particularly the children of immigrants who are straddling two different cultures “enjoy the fact that they’re consuming something that is really kind of traditional, but in this very new, modern, contemporary context,” said Sally Howell, professor of Arab American studies at the University of Michigan–Dearborn. In the Middle East, coffee isn’t a grab-and-go drink used to wake up with, but a social exchange. While coffee beans originated in Ethiopia, the earliest evidence of cultivation appeared in Yemen through trading across the Red Sea. The practice followed into the early 20th century and across the world, when the first wave of Middle Eastern immigrants came to Detroit to work in the auto industry or shipping yards, Howell said. Most immigrants were men who migrated alone, so one of the first institutions they created were coffee houses where they would gather to socialize, share news about their home country, and even write letters back home. Many of the initial mosques in the area were originally established in the backs of the coffee houses. Yemeni men working in shipping on the Great Lakes“would work for months at a time and then have a few weeks off and then work again,” leaving them unable to visit their families back in Yemen, Howell said. “The coffee houses in the Detroit area were a really important institution.” “Our mission is to bring everyone in one place and share history,” Ibrahim Alhasbani, founder of the first contemporary Yemeni coffee chain Qahwah House, told CNN. “That’s why we serve the coffee in a pot. People come inside the store and they share one pot and they can talk and they share different stories.” Contemporary chains are designed by a new demographic — the descendants of these immigrants who are bringing Yemeni coffee culture to the American mainstream. The very first Qahwah Houses in Dearborn were airy and upscale, a familiar setting to patrons of established coffee chains. But they also brought with them Yemeni culture, with coffee beans imported from local farmers, artifacts from the region and the founder’s family tree on the wall. “I come from a background of family farmers. We own the coffee farms in Yemen, we grew up with the coffee, we loved coffee,” Alhasbani said. The new generation of Yemenis in the area benefitted from the support of a more established community, Howell said. Those like Alhasbani came in with investors: Yemeni entrepreneurs, professionals, medical professionals and engineers who give back to their community by sponsoring younger people. Business experts say customers are attracted to authenticity. For example, Alhasbani hand mixes the ingredients for the drinks at his factory in Michigan and the coffee beans still come from farmers in Yemen. “There’s been a lot of emphasis, especially in specialty coffee but also in the entertainment space, on being authentic and being real,” Hovig Tchalian, Assistant Professor of Clinical Entrepreneurship at USC Marshall School of Business, told CNN. During the day, Yemeni coffeehouses function similar to many neighborhood spots. Patrons host meetings, college students study and others pop in for a quick cup to-go. But at night, they serve as de-facto living rooms, especially for young Muslims who don’t go to clubs and bar. From New York to Dallas, especially during the late nights of Ramadan, the crowd overflows into the street and you often have to yell to be heard inside. Some young Muslimseven venture to the coffee shops in hopes of finding a life partner. Nowhere is this coffeehouse culture more pronounced, and celebrated, than in Dearborn, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit and home to one of the largest Arab American communities in the United States. Downtown Dearborn is peppered with different Yemeni coffee houses, which Howell said helped revitalize the Detroit area after the citybecame the largest municipality go to bankrupt in 2013. And it’s only growing. “It’s become sort of contagious,” Howell said. “Several Yemeni entrepreneurs are opening coffee houses of their own, each with its own sort of style and atmosphere.” The coffee chains have big ambitions beyond Dearborn. Qahwah House hopes to open another 20 to 30 locations in the next year, spanning across 12 states and Canada, Alhasbani said. They are also licensed out, but Alhasbani says he sets a high standard before agreeing to let anyone open a shop. “We have too many people that come (asking me) they want to open. I have more than 10 different requests a day just to open this kind of business,” he said. “We don’t give anyone license until we make sure the person has the love for the brand and his mind and his heart in the Qahwah House.” Another authentic Yemeni coffee chain, Haraz, also sees crowds of people throughout the day and night. They opened their first location in New York City last week — less than half a mile away from Qahwah House’s downtown Manhattan shop — and the franchisees plan to grow. But growth isn’t without challenges. Haraz directly sources its coffee from the high-altitude region in Yemen it’s named after. Sinceshipping from the Red Sea has become difficultor delayed, co-franchisee Ahmed Moustafa said they have three years of beans on reserve in Michigan so they can keep up with demand while preserving the original flavor. At Haraz’s newest location, the space visibly resembles Islamic architecture, with pointed arches adorning the walls. But its location in pricey Soho aims to branch outside of the Middle Eastern communities in Brooklyn and Queens. “I had feedback from a lady that lives around the block, she said ‘I didn’t even know about coffee from Yemen,’” Moustafa said.",Not Found
69,Jury awards Apple $250 in design patent lawsuit against Masimo,"Apple convinced a federal jury on Friday that health monitoring tech company Masimo’s smartwatches infringe two of its design patents. The jury, in Delaware, agreed with Apple that Masimo’s W1 and Freedom watches and chargers willfully violated Apple’s patent rights in smartwatch designs, awarding the tech giant $250 in damages. Apple’s attorneys told the court the “ultimate purpose” of its lawsuit was to win an injunction against sales of Masimo’s smartwatches after an infringement ruling. The jury also determined that Masimo’s watches did not infringe Apple patents covering smartwatch inventions that the tech giant had accused Masimo of copying. Masimo said in a statement that the company appreciated the jury’s verdict “in favor of Masimo and against Apple on nearly all issues,” and that the decision only applied to a “discontinued module and charger.” “Apple primarily sought an injunction against Masimo’s current products, and the jury’s verdict is a victory for Masimo on that issue,” Masimo said. Apple said in a statement that it was “glad the jury’s decision today will protect the innovations we advance on behalf of our customers.” Irvine, California-based Masimo accused Apple of hiring away its employees and stealing its pulse oximetry technology after discussing a potential collaboration. Masimo convinced the U.S. International Trade Commission last year toblock importsof Apple’s Series 9 and Ultra 2 smartwatches after the commission found that their technology for reading blood oxygen levels infringed Masimo’s patents. Apple has appealed the decision and resumed selling the watches after removing the technology. The tech giant countersued Masimo for patent infringement in 2022, alleging that Masimo copied Apple Watch features to use in its smartwatches. Apple also accused Masimo of using lawsuits at the ITC and in California to “make way for Masimo’s own watch.” Masimo said Apple’s patent lawsuit was “retaliatory” and “an attempt to avoid the court in which the parties have been litigating their dispute.”",Not Found
70,"Why Nike, Starbucks and Boeing have lost their magic","Three quintessentially American companies — Starbucks, Nike and Boeing — share a common predicament at the moment. Each has a new CEO at the helm with a mission to clean house and, critically, return the brand to its former glory. None of them have an easy job ahead, as this week made painfully clear. Here’s the tea: A preliminary earnings report Tuesday revealed yet another quarter offalling sales at Starbucks— its third in a row. The drop was especially steep in the US, where sales fell 10%; and in China, where they were down 14%. Basically, demand hasn’t been this low since the first year of the pandemic. The numbers were so ugly that Starbucks took the uncommon step of suspending its financial guidance for the rest of the year — a move that should, in theory, give the new boss time to figure out a plan. Brian Niccol took the reins last month, leaving the top job at Chipotle to become Starbucks’ third CEO in three years. But even for Niccol, the guy known throughout the industry as something of a savior to spiraling companies, this is going to be a Herculean task. So far, Niccol has said he wants to simplify the menus, improve staffing levels and he may even — please, for the love of God — put the milk and sugar out from behind the counter. “We need to fundamentally change our strategy so we can get back to growth,” he said. “People love Starbucks, but I’ve heard from some customers that we’ve drifted from our core.” In short: Bring back the chill community coffee shop vibe from the ’90s. And maybe stop trying to make usdrink olive oil. Nike is in a similar boat. Its stock is down some 25% this year, and revenue fell 10% last quarter from a year earlier. Like Starbucks,it’s got a new bosswho everyone hopes will swoop in with big ideas to return the brand to its former glory. Easier said than done, of course. Nike’s problems stem from its own strategic missteps — like not focusing enough on making cool shoes — as well as growing competition from younger upstart brands like Hoka and On. The new guy, Elliott Hill, is only a couple of weeks in but already secured a 12-season extension of Nike’s partnership with the NBA and WNBA, ensuring the swoosh will stay on pro-basketball’s uniforms and official apparel. Next on the list of to-dos: Figure out how tomake the shoes cool again. And finally, there’s Boeing.Boeing Boeing Boeing…. Things were already a shambles when Kelly Ortberg took over as CEO in August, and somehow they’ve actually deteriorated. On Wednesday, union workers who’ve been striking for the past six weeks rejectedBoeing’s offerto return to work, meaning the work stoppage that’s draining about $1 billion a month from the company will carry on. Oh, and on the same day, Boeing reported a $6 billion third-quarter loss, one of thelargest quarterly lossesin the company’s history. All of that’s happening on the heels of a year that started with one of its plane’s door plugs blowing out in mid-air. Which came on the heels of a six-year chapter marked by dual tragedies, damning revelations about the company’s systemic failures and the near-total erosion of Boeing’s reputation for quality and safety. Like Nike and Starbucks, Boeing is looking to its past self to guide its future. Unfortunately for Ortberg, the rot goes back well over a decade. And Boeing won’t be able to build the time machine it so desperately needs without the 33,000 machinists currently on strike.",Global
71,Amazon Prime introduces a new benefit to save on gas,"Prime members can now add “fuel discounts” to their ever-growing list of benefits. The newest perk from e-commerce giant Amazon will allow members to save 10 cents per gallon at the gas pump (up to an average of nearly $70 a year) at around 7,000 participating BP, Amoco, and AM/PM stations across the US. Members can avail themselvesof the discount by linking their Amazon account to Earnify, a loyalty program app by BP. Data from GasBuddyshows that gas prices are at their lowest since January, but with global oil prices spiking due to ongoing conflict in the Middle East,worries about a potential gasoline price surgeremain. Amazon’s newest savings benefit could alleviate some of that potential grief for its over 184 million Prime subscribers. The fuel discount offering is Prime’s latest addition to its laundry list of member benefits, which span music andvideo streaming services, food and grocery delivery, and even medical care and prescription drug savings. And in a world wheremembership programs now seem practically ubiquitous, the move represents Amazon’s efforts to stay ahead of the game. Fuel and energy probably isn’t the first sector to come to mind when you think of Amazon, but analysts say that the recent inclusion of gas savings doesn’t come as too much of a surprise. “Amazon’s view has always been that the more benefits you add and the more rounded you make the program, the more difficult it is to leave,” said Neil Saunders, retail analyst and managing director at GlobalData Retail. Saunders told CNN that Amazon’s move into gasoline likely stems from a keenness to compete with its rival,Walmart+, which offers similar 10-cent fuel savings at 14,000 U.S. stations. And as more paid membership schemes like Target Circle 360 and Wayfair’s recently announced Wayfair Rewards program enter the market, Prime is going the extra mile to demonstrate its value to subscribers. “Other retailers are still playing catch up to Amazon, and Amazon wants to retain its lead,” Saunders said. “So, as the other retailers run faster to add more bells and whistles, Amazon is doing the same thing to keep its position ahead of the pack.” Still, Amazon’s attempt toposition itself as the “everything company”comes with its own set of challenges. For one, there iscustomer confusion. According to Saunders, the larger the program, the more diffused it becomes.Customers who take advantage of onebenefit might not find any use for another. Pricing is another issue.An annual Prime subscription costs $139— that’s around 40% higher than Walmart and Target memberships, which are priced at $98 and $99, respectively. Amazon customers who don’t utilize the full extent of their memberships could feel like they’re getting less bang for their buck and switch to a lower-priced alternative. “Amazon is going to have to work quite hard to understand how Prime is being used across different memberships to make sure that it actually is offering genuine value rather than just chucking a lot of stuff out there,” Saunders said.",Global
72,US businesses are suffering from election uncertainty — and it could be hurting the economy,"This year’s election is shaping up to be particularly ugly for the business world, with two presidential candidates who could not be further apart in theirapproaches to taxesand regulation. On top of that, control of Congress is also up for grabs, which could significantly hurt or help the chance that Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump could see their agendas for the country unfold. That’s helped push uncertainty among small business owners to an all-time high since the nearly 40-year inception of a monthly survey the National Federation of Independent Business conducts to gauge small business sentiment. Anxiety about the election has forced businesses of all sizes into an uncomfortable holding pattern that ultimately could negatively impact their bottom lines and the US economy as a whole, experts say. Nearly a third of people in financial decision-making roles said they “postponed,” “scaled down,” “delayed indefinitely,” or “permanently canceled” their short-term and long-term investment plans because of election uncertainty this year, a recent Federal Reserve survey shows. These leaders predict their firms’ revenue and employment growth this year will be lower than that of firms whose investment plans aren’t impacted by the election. That’s according to the latest quarterly CFO survey from the Atlanta and Richmond Federal Reserve banks, in conjunction with Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. The survey panel includes leaders from smaller US businesses as well as at Fortune 500 companies across all major industries nationwide. The scale of firms whose investment plans are impacted by election uncertainty is “pretty remarkable” compared to prior elections, said Daniel Weitz, survey director at the Atlanta Fed. This could “have a very meaningful impact” on the trajectory of the overall economy, he said, though it could prove to be temporary. The Fed’s Beige Book, a quarterly collection of survey responses from businesses compiled by the 12 regional Fed banks published Wednesday, highlighted a wide range of businesses that are suffering because of election uncertainty. For instance, manufacturing firms surveyed by the Cleveland Fed reported some producers were holding off on placing new orders. The regional Fed bank also noted that two commercial builders said, “Many companies were planning to wait until after the general election to undertake construction projects.” Meanwhile, the Richmond Fed reported that a textile manufacturer surveyed“expected tepid demand because customers were buying cautiously until the new year due to the ‘usual nervous period’ ahead of elections.” Even leaders of nonprofit organizations said their operations were taking a hit because “economic and election uncertainty has led to hesitancy to give among some donors,” the Dallas Fed reported. Leading up to prior presidential elections, firms were much less likely to experience these effects from the uncertain outcome, said Brent Meyer, assistant vice president and economist at the Atlanta Fed. The difference now is Harris’ late entry into the race and howclose she’s pollingto Trump, he said. But the blowback that businesses are facing from the election uncertainty should subside once the policy path ahead becomes more clear, at which point we could start to see a rebound in hiring and capital investment businesses make, Meyer told CNN. That’s why he said people should be careful not to “over-interpret weakness (in the economy) in the moment and over-interpret strength next year.” The election is undeniably playing a big role in businesses’ uneasiness, but that’s not the only thing unsettling them. They’re alsoweighing the uncertain pathof interest rates since the Federal Reserve began cutting last month, as well as thepending lapseof major provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The combination of these three major unknowns is shaping small business owners’ uncertain outlooks, said Holly Wade, executive director of the NFIB Research Center. “We’re still seeing small firms telling us that their rates haven’t eased up as much as some would have expected,” she told CNN, referring to the interest rates they’re paying to borrow money. That’s why the share of small business owners making capital investments is dwindling, Wade said, citing a September NFIB survey, which also noted that more firms are “reducing inventories than adding to them.” If the Fed continues to cut rates at upcoming meetings, as expected, that would reduce borrowing costs and could reignite investment plans no matter which party scores more victories this election, Wade said.",Global
73,This viral banana artwork is on sale again — and it could now be worth $1.5 million,"When a banana duct-taped to a wallsold for $120,000in 2019, social media uproar and an age-old debate about the meaning of art ensued. But artist Maurizio Cattelan’s viral creation, titled “Comedian,” may yet prove a sound investment: On Friday, auction house Sotheby’s announced that one of the artwork’s three “editions” is going back on sale — this time with an estimate of $1 million to $1.5 million. For their money, the winning bidder will receive a roll of duct tape and one banana, as well as a certificate of authenticity and official instructions for installing the work. Sotheby’s confirmed to CNN that neither the tape nor, thankfully, the banana are the originals. “‘Comedian’ is a conceptual artwork, and the actual physical materials are replaced with every installation,” an auction spokesperson said via email. Cattelan and French art gallery Perrotin made headlines around the world five years ago when they displayed “Comedian” with a six-figure asking price at the Art Basel Miami Beach fair. The original was created using a banana bought in a Miami grocery store, though the gallery said it could be replaced, as per the artist’s instructions. The art world was split on the work’s merits, though some critics saw it as rooted in therich tradition of conceptual works— dating back to Marcel Duchamp’s famous mounted urinal — that question the value of art itself. Crowds soon formed, with fair attendees lining up to see the viral installation. Events took an unexpected turn when performance artist David Datuna grabbed the banana from the wall, before peeling and eating it in front of hundreds of stunned fair attendees. He laterdefended the moveas an artistic performance in its own right, not an act of vandalism. The Miami installation was eventually removed amid public safety concerns, but all three editions were sold at the fair. Two were bought by private collectors for $120,000, while the third was purchased fora higher(but undisclosed) sum, and was later donated to The Guggenheim museum in New York. Sotheby’s would not reveal the identity of the seller in November’s auction, but said the work’s current owner had acquired it from the collection of one of the original buyers. In interviews given since the Miami installation, Cattelan has described “Comedian” as a work of commentary. Speaking to the Art Newspaper in 2021 hesaidit was “not a joke,” calling the viral installation “a reflection on what we value.” The Italian artist, who is known for satirical pieces that challenge popular culture, did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment about November’s sale. In a press release announcing the sale, Sotheby’s head of contemporary art for the Americas, David Galperin, described “Comedian” as a “defiant work of pure genius.” “Balancing profound critical thought and subversive wit, this is a defining work for the artist and for our generation,” Galperin said, adding: “If at its core, ‘Comedian’ questions the very notion of the value of art, then putting the work at auction… will be the ultimate realization of its essential conceptual idea — the public will finally have a say in deciding its true value.” While this marks the first time “Comedian” will appear at auction, the work was recently exhibited at the Leeum Museum of Art in Seoul, South Korea. It was eaten then, too: An art student from Seoul National University removed the fruit anddevoured it, before taping the peel back to the wall. “The student told the museum he ate it because he was hungry,” a gallery spokesperson told CNN after the 2023 incident. The museum later replaced the eaten banana with a fresh one. Sotheby’s intends to exhibit the artwork ahead of the sale, which takes place at the auction house’s New York headquarters on November 20. “Comedian” will be put on show there on Monday before it embarks on a world tour stopping in London, Paris, Milan, Hong Kong, Dubai, Taipei, Tokyo and Los Angeles.",New York
74,‘Proof of how hard I fought’: Why Olivia Munn chose to show her mastectomy scars in new Skims campaign,"Olivia Munn is the latest star to model for shapewear brand Skims, and in the campaign images the actor shows her mastectomy scars as she continues her fight against breast cancer. In the photographs, taken by artist Vanessa Beecroft, Munn models products by the Kim Kardashian-founded lingerie and shapewear brand, including a head-turning nipple illusion bra. Launched in the final week of Breast Cancer Awareness Month as a partnership with the Susan G. Komen organization, the campaign encourages women to pursue early screenings, according to a press release. Munn has advocated for people to calculate theirbreast cancer risk score, which helped lead to her diagnosis early last year. “This cause is deeply personal to me, and I’m proud to help drive awareness and conversation around it,” Munn said in the release. “SKIMS’ commitment to empowerment and community aligns perfectly with the message of this campaign, which is all about confidence, comfort, and feeling your best self. That’s exactly how I felt shooting this.” Last month, Munn shared a timeline of her breast cancer journey on social media, which has included multiple mammograms, ultrasounds and a genetic test in 2022 and early 2023. All of those screenings came back negative. But in March, her physician screened her using the Tyrer-Cuzick Risk Assessment Calculator and found Munn’s lifetime risk was 37.3%, more than triple the risk of the general population. This led her to pursue more testing including an MRI and biopsies. She was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer in April 2024, and has since undergone a double mastectomy and reconstruction along with other treatments. Munn also had surgery for a partial hysterectomy this past April, she noted, several months after undergoing egg retrieval. She and her husband, the comedian John Mulaney, welcomed their second child via a surrogate in September. In apodcast episodewith the Susan G. Komen organization, Munn spoke more on the importance of her campaign with Skims. “When people think of SKIMS, they think of beauty and sexiness, and with breast cancer, I think that it’s not always the first thing that people think about, maybe like not even in the top hundred.” She revealed she had initially wanted to cover some of her scars for the project, but experienced a moment in between shots that changed her mind. “After my first shot with this one black bodysuit, we were changing and we were touching up my scars with my makeup artist. And then it just hit me after she touched up one scar that is placed in a way that I haven’t really learned to love yet,” she recalled. “But I was looking at my mastectomy scars and I was thinking about the first time I saw them and how shocking it was for me. And I thought, you know what? I do look at these scars as proof of how hard I fought. And I think I want to not only embrace the scars right now but show other women who have these same scars that there’s nothing to feel bad about.” Munn joins celebrities including Sabrina Carpenter, Megan Fox, Heidi Klum, Cardi B and Lana Del Ray, who have all modeled for Kardashian’s brand. Skims has a history of supporting social causes, and has previously made donations to families affected by COVID-19 as well as to Ukraine relief efforts. The brand also recently landed high-profile partnerships with the WNBA and NBA, and worked with Team USA at the summer Olympics in Paris. Through the end of the month, Skims says it will donate a portion of its bra sales to Susan G. Komen in support of breast cancer research and awareness.",Global
75,Tiny house with elaborate – and erotic – frescoes unearthed at Pompeii,"Archaeologists have uncovered a tiny house inPompeiithat is filled with elaborate – and sometimes erotic –frescoes, further revealing the ornate way in which Romans decorated their homes. Situated in the central district of the ancient city, the house is smaller than normal and unusually lacks the open central courtyard – known as an atrium – that is typical of Roman architecture, the Archaeological Park of Pompeii, which oversees the site, said in a statement Thursday. This change could have occurred due to shifting trends in Roman - and particularly Pompeian - society, during the first century AD, archaeologists said. Pompeii was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in AD 79 when its buildings and thousands of inhabitants were buried beneath layers of ash and pumice. This coating perfectly preserved the city for millennia, making it one of the most important archaeological sites in the world as it offers an unprecedented insight into Roman daily life. This latest discovery spotlights the ornate decorations that rich Romans enjoyed in their homes – several frescoes depict mythical scenes and others are decorated with plant and animal motifs on a white background. One small square painting set against a blue-painted wall depicts intercourse between a satyr and a nymph, while another shows Hippolytus, son of the mythical Greek king Theseus, and his stepmother Phaedra who fell in love with him before killing herself when he rejected her in disgust. One fresco likely portrays the Judgement of Paris, though it has been damaged by previous excavations, and another shows Venus, the goddess of love, and Adonis, her mortal lover. Erotic and elaborate frescoes like this have been uncovered in Pompeii before. One house covered in erotic frescoes reopened to the public in January 2023 after being closed for 20 years while another fresco depicting an erotic scene from the Greek myth “Leda and the Swan” was uncovered in 2018. Elsewhere in this newly excavated house, the last ritual offerings left before the eruption still remain at the household shrine, known as a lararium. “We have archaeologists, restorers, archaeobotanists here to understand exactly how the ritual of the last sacrifice was carried out before the eruption,” said Gabriel Zuchtriegel, the park’s director, in a statement.  “There are still the burnt remains of this ritual, there is the knife that was used.” This excavation, Zuchtriegel added, “takes place under the eyes of the public” who can access the site on suspended walkways and watch archaeologists working.",Not Found
76,"These are 2024’s top trending Halloween costumes, according to Google","AnOlympic breakdancer, a Chipotle burrito and a pop star walk into a bar. This may sound like the start to a bad joke, but it could be a scene unfolding across the US on October 31, according to online search data. Google’s annual “Frightgeist” list has unveiled 25 costume ideas the tech giant says are “trending” in the build-up to Halloween. The list, based on comparisons of year-on-year search data from September, is also something of a who’s who of pop culture in 2024. Top of this year’s list is Bob, a shrunken-headed ghost from the recent“Beetlejuice” sequel. Viral breakdancer Raygun took second place, with Google noting a spike in searches for “green and yellow track suit” and “green track pants,” as worn during the Australian’s controversial Olympics performance. Third place went to CatNap, the cat-like monster from the popular video game series “Poppy Playtime.” Also in the top 10 were Deadpool’s female counterpart Lady Deadpool and singerSabrina Carpenter, whose cut-out heart corset has spiked in searches this year, according to Google Trends. Elsewhere, a total of five characters from Pixar’s “Inside Out” movies — the anthropomorphized emotions Envy, Anger, Disgust, Anxiety and Joy — featured in the top 25. So, too, did Chipotle burritos (11th), Sonic’s nemesis Shadow the Hedgehog (20th), rapper Soulja Boy (24th) and three other characters from “Beetlejuice.” (Both “Beetlejuice” movies were released by Warner Bros., which is owned by CNN’s parent company, Warner Bros.

77,Curators are unraveling the mysteries of the belated art icon Tamara de Lempicka,"With her portraits of red-lipped women painted like sculptures in resplendent jewel tones, the Polish painter Tamara de Lempicka has posthumously become an Art Deco icon. Her figures are sumptuous and moody, seemingly longing for something more as they pose in front of crowded skylines or behind the wheel of a car, scarves and draped gowns billowing in the wind. Though Lempicka never found sustained critical success during her lifetime (she died in 1980), she’s collected today by superstars including Barbra Streisand and Madonna — the latter who displayedsome of Lempicka’s paintings onstageduring her “Celebration” tour last year. Lempicka’s market has soared, with a painting of cabaret singer Marjorie Ferry setting her auction record at £16.3 million ($21.3 million) in 2020. A century after the height of her career, Lempicka’s life and work are fascinating the art world more than ever. Lempicka has never received a major museum retrospective in the US — until now. A new show at the de Young, a part of the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco, will showcase more than 150 works. “She captured optimism as Europe was rebuilding itself after the First World War,” explained curator Furio Rinaldi — who organized the show with art historian and Lempicka biographer Gioia Mori — in a video call with CNN. “There was an electrifying sense of hope (for) a future and world where women had a new role; they entered the workforce in a massive way,” he said. “The fashion changed because they needed garments that allowed much more movement and freedom of expression and Lempicka really captured the essence of this new woman: liberated, sexually free, financially independent.” But Lempicka is often not given her due, Rinaldi explained, with her impact simplified. “She’s been perceived — mostly by art historians — as a phenomenon of the Art Deco period… of the world of decoration and fashion,” he said. “But actually she was much more than that. She’s an incredibly gifted and outstanding painter, possibly one of the best of her generation.” Lempicka was born at the end of the 19th century to a wealthy Polish family, though her exact place of birth is still unknown. She later settled in St. Petersburg, but was forced to flee the Russian Revolution and made her way to Paris in 1919. There, Lempicka blended a number of styles to make her own. Over her career, she took notes from the Russian avant-garde, the flat planes of cubism, the elegance of fashion illustration and advertising, and the composition and form of the Italian Renaissance and French Neoclassical painters. But she was an outlier of major art movements and wasn’t always taken seriously on account of her aristocratic background — she was bitingly nicknamed the “Baroness with a Brush” in print in 1941. Today, it’s difficult to stage a large showing of Lempicka’s work, Rinaldi explained, since her paintings and drawings are mostly in private collections, rather than in museums, and can change hands repeatedly. “That had a great impact on her critical appreciation, because she’s not represented in museums and she’s not really seen as part of the canon,” he said. In 2021, the de Young acquired a drawing by Lempicka — a study of a young girl with ringlets and arched eyebrows she composed in 1937. It made the institution the first in the country to purchase one of her works, Rinaldi said. But three years on, the de Young’s curators have organized a full show filled with rarely and never-before-seen works. They have also uncovered new information about the enigmatic artist, who often concealed or exaggerated details about her life and had a penchant for communicating through dramatic press releases. Streisand, who penned an opening essay for the show catalog, described Lempicka as a woman who “moved easily through the highest echelons of society — a cool, glamorous blonde with an air of mystery who had lovers of both sexes.” Rinaldi pointed to her savvy sense of self-promotion. “She made great use of the media of the time,” he said. “She lied about some things. She introduced her daughter as her younger sister — sometimes silly things, sometimes more serious things. But certainly it shows a woman who’s fully in control of her life and her identity, who’s crafting her own persona.” Some of Lempicka’s exaggerations were meant to place her in key historical moments, such as her claim that she arrived in New York from Europe on the very day the stock market crashed in 1929, catapulting the country into the Great Depression (she had actually arrived several months earlier). But other misrepresentations were an armor of sorts, like her Polish Catholic identity, when evidence points to Moscow as her birthplace, and research has recently revealed her Jewish heritage. “Her grandparents are buried in the Jewish cemetery in Warsaw, but her parents converted to Christianity and baptized their children,” Streisand wrote. “It was safer not to be Jewish, and Lempicka clearly understood that. She painted her only daughter, Kizette, in her First Communion dress and made sure she was identified as Catholic.” In the show “Tamara de Lempicka,” the curators reveal her birth name for the first time: Tamara Rosa Hurwitz. They also update her birth year to 1894, four to eleven years earlier than Lempicka claimed when she was alive, based on documentation found by the Polish historian Andrzej Slowicki. And there’s new works on display for the very first time, including the 1928 painting “Spring,” of two women, one appearing to whisper to the other as she cradles small white blooms. The exhibition spans from early Russian folkloric-influenced compositions in the 1920s; to the sultry nudes and modern, aristocratic portraits that became her calling card; to the quieter tabletop scenes she began painting during World War II. It includes the first painting that caught Streisand’s eye from a book cover the singer spotted in 1979: a self-portrait of Lempicka, her gaze fixed on the viewer as she drives a green Bugatti. Lempicka received her first solo show in 1930 in Paris, and exhibited regularly around the city in the early years of her career. But that decade and the following, her style was “not aligned” with Surrealism or Abstract Expressionism, which prevailed as the dominant art movements, Rinaldi noted. “As maybe a defensive reaction, she really goes back to an extreme appreciation for the Old Masters, and she starts producing these religious scenes or very humble, simple still lives.” The only group she fully embraced with was The Society of Modern Women Artists in Paris, which promoted equal representation of women in art and hosted an annual salon in which she participated throughout the 1930s. When she returned to the US just before war broke out in Europe in 1939, she exhibited at Pittsburgh’s Carnegie Institute. Later, she and her second husband, Baron Kuffner, funded a traveling exhibition in New York, San Francisco and Milwaukee with the famed art dealer Julien Levy — eight of the twelve works from this original San Francisco stop hang in a recreated room in the de Young show. In the 1940s, Lempicka’s work was the subject of a book for the first time, coinciding with an exhibition in Rome. But until the very last years of her life, when the Art Deco period had a scholarly resurgence, interest in her work remained thin and she considered her style “out of the fashion,” the de Young’s catalog notes. Though Lempicka’s art is in fashion once again, and has enjoyed sustained interest for decades, Rinaldi says there’s still much scholarly and curatorial work to do to uncover her secrets. “We’re really chipping just the surface of what can be done, what can be discovered about her,” he said. Clarification: This story has been updated to include attribution of the discovery of the artist’s birth year.",San Francisco
78,"Meet Rojé Stona, an Olympic track and field champion with dreams of playing in the NFL","Track and field will never fail to surprise its fans: a sport full of tiny details, where the smallest of margins separates moments of glory from those of agony and heartache. Jamaican discus throwerRojé Stonalearned this the hard way. When he approached the discus circle before his fourth attempt during the men’s final at theParis Olympics, he didn’t expect that three centimeters (roughly 1.2 inches) would cause a pleasant dilemma for his next career move. Stona – who finished 19th in the 2023 World Athletics Championships and was ranked 12th before competing in the French capital – etched his name into the history books, becoming the first Jamaican to win gold in a throwing event. His 70-meter effort broke the Olympic record set minutes prior by Lithuania’sMykolas Alekna, a heavy favorite going into the Games. “Winning was something I’ve been thinking about, but to be in the moment, it felt different,” the Jamaican toldCNN Sport, reflecting on his victorious night in the Stade de France. “It was definitely great because I created a lot of history, and I learned a lot afterwards that I’ve done more than what I thought.” Now, the 25-year-old Stona is now intrigued by a switch to a completely different sport having participated in rookie training camps with theNFL’sGreen Bay PackersandNew Orleans Saints. He doesn’t have much experience in football – only putting on a helmet for the first time in his debut training session – but would be willing to risk his promising athletics career for a spot on an NFL team’s roster. “If there’s like a 99 percent chance that I’ll make a team, then, obviously, I’ll go for it, but if it’s like one or two, though, I got to be realistic,” he said. Stona was only nine when compatriot Usain Bolt won his first Olympic gold medal in Beijing 2008. Despite soccer being his first love, seeing the greatest sprinter of all time win at the Olympics was a big driver in pursuing a career in track and field. After trying many of the sports in athletics, he settled on his future discipline in high school. “I yanked it, it just dropped right out of 20 meters,” Stona recalled the first moment he picked up a discus. After moving through the ranks and representing the Caribbean nation in youth competitions, Stona moved to the US to study at Clemson and later Arkansas. In Fayetteville, he met Ryan Crouser – a three-time Olympic gold medalist and an Olympic record holder in shot put – who joined the Razorbacks’ athletics staff in 2019 as a volunteer. Mentorship from “one of the best that have ever done it” throughout the last year of his collegiate eligibility filled Stona with confidence; he watched and soaked in Crouser’s knowledge while trying to replicate his success. The road to the Olympics started with a statement performance for Stona, a 69-meter throw in April during the Oklahoma Throws Series World Invitational meet to guarantee the Jamaican a spot in Paris. Stona had ambitious goals in Paris, aiming to “at least finish top three.” He didn’t want to spend another summer wondering ‘what if?’ When competition started, it seemed like everything was going according to a pre-written script: Alekna broke his father Virgilijus’ Olympic record which had stood since 2004, and it looked like the Lithuanian was on track for gold. But Stona had other plans: his fourth attempt on the night sailed 70 meters, breaking the Olympic record set minutes earlier and causing one of the biggest upsets of the Games. “When Mykolas broke the record, I was like, ‘Alright, I could expect that.’ I gave him my respect because we are throwers; I used to watch Alekna’s dad when I just started discus,” he said. “From the way that I held the discus, the angle of where I caught the discus in my power position, the speed of my right arm coming around, that’s something I’ve been aiming for, and I’m just blessed that it came at the right moment,” Stona said of his moment in the spotlight. “Everybody is unique in their own way, and that throw for me was one of the best throws ever.” Stona had practiced celebrations during his time in the Olympic Village out of boredom, and now they came out in full force. He did both Yusuf Dikeç’s casual and nonchalant shooting pose that went viral and Real Madrid star Jude Bellingham’s iconic pose to celebrate his moment of glory. During his preparation for the biggest moment of his career, Stona went on a short break from discus training to take part in two NFL rookie camps with the Packers and the Saints during the summer. He instantly fell in love with football after being exposed to the game while studying at Clemson, and was one of the few track and field college athletes invited to show what he’s capable of in a sport he has never played before. Stona wasdescribedby veteran NFL analyst Lance Zierlein as “a track standout with an NFL body type and traits … who possesses explosive hips and above-average core strength to pair with very long arms and huge hands.” His invite to the camps, therefore, was no surprise. Trying out as a defensive end and tight end, Stona described his first camp in Green Bay as “a different world” and “like learning a new language” as he had to rapidly change the mindset from a fan to a student of the game. “The coaches are not going to be like, ‘Oh, he’s new to football, let’s break it down for him,’” he said. “That’s why they are trying to test every rookie because I’m just like one of the rookies, I’m a trial guy, so they’re not making it easy. “I watched the guys that go in front of me and try to make sure that I do similar or mimic what they’ve done and be coachable.” While the current NFL season is underway, it’s looking likely that Stona won’t get picked up by any team mid-season – he said that he wants to prioritize rest and recovery after a long athletics season – but he admitted he feels interested to see what he can do wearing a helmet and shoulder pads. “Everywhere I go, people don’t ask, ‘Hey, you’re a discus thrower?’ No, people don’t ask that!” said Stona. “Especially being around in the States, they ask, ‘Do you play football?’ “As soon as I get advice from agents and coaches, that will put me in a better position to make a very important decision or just be more decisive if it’s worth it or not. “If that part leads me there, then I’m going to give it my all because it’s kind of now or never. I’m curious as to what I can do on the field, and if I end up playing in the NFL, that would be a part of my legacy – I’d love to do that.” As far as Stona’s promising athletics career goes, he says he wants to use every chance to compete at a high level and aims to compete at every major championship over the next two seasons. The gold medal in Paris gave Stona “some next level of confidence” to pick up where he left off. He finished second in his Diamond League debut in Rome, and with an impressive win in the French capital on his resume, he could settle into the discus throwing elite for the foreseeable future. “Now that I’ve thrown 70 meters, I’ve gotten used to that type of distance, I know what it takes to get there,” Stona said. “So now there’s definitely a chance that I can still compete at a high level.”",Global
79,Inter Miami beats Atlanta United in Lionel Messi’s MLS playoff debut,"Inter Miami beat Atlanta United 2-1 on Friday in what wasLionel Messi’sMajor League Soccer (MLS) playoff debut. It was two of his former Barcelona teammates who got the goals, with Luis Suárez opening the scoring in the second minute and Jordi Alba’s long-range strike on the hour mark sealing the victory, with Messi himself providing the assist. Saba Lobzhanidze had equalized for Atlanta in the 39thminute, but the stunning 25-yard effort from Inter Miami’s left back provided the decisive goal. The win gives Miami a one-game lead in the best-of-three first round series of the MLS playoffs, with Game 2 being played on November 2 at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta. “It’s not easy to find fullbacks who are so decisive, who contribute so much to the offensive game of the team – Dani Alves, Cafu, Marcelo, Roberto Carlos, they’re all at that level,” Miami head coach Gerardo Martino said afterwards, per MLS, about Alba’s impact on the team. “Technically, he has a quality that is very rare in a wide defender, and is better when he understands where Luis and Leo are and can find them, and how they can find him, if they can find Jordi. For sure, it is difficult to find a player who plays in his position and is as decisive.” Although Messi didn’t find the back of the net, the Argentine was prominently involved throughout the game at Chase Stadium, contributing the assist for Alba’s game-winning goal and troubling the Atlanta goal consistently. The 37-year-old drew numerous saves from Atlanta’s goalkeeper Brad Guzan, as well as striking the post midway through the first half. His assist for Alba’s second-half strike – Alba’s fifth goal of the season – was Messi’s 17th this year. The victory was the perfect start to the postseason for Miami which enters with plenty of pressure riding on its shoulders. Not only does it have a star-studded squad laden with veteran talent, but it entered the playoffs as the No. 1 overall seed after a successful regular season where it lost just four times on the way to 74 points, the most in the league. “It was a match where what I liked the most was the control we had on the field for almost the entire game,” Martino said afterwards, per Inter Miami. “We didn’t make many mistakes that would allow the opponent to break out into space. “We had five clear chances in the first half, and one of them came very close to the post. We were patient. I believe that if it weren’t for Brad (Guzan)’s performance, the match should have ended with a clear difference.” Atlanta had advanced to this stage of the MLS playoffs after beating Montreal on penalties in the wild card round.",Not Found
80,Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa cleared to return and will play Sunday against Arizona Cardinals,"Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa has been cleared from concussion protocol and is set to play Sunday against the Arizona Cardinals, head coach Mike McDaniel told reporters Friday, emphasizing that medical experts have expressed support for the star to return. “After going through the process, and having a practice where we were able to initiate some contact with him, and then he met with an independent doctor and was fully cleared,” McDaniel said. “He is out of the protocol.” “Tua met with a litany – a laundry list, a long list – of medical experts and zero of them recommended that he shouldn’t play football,” McDaniel said. “That means 100% of them were supporting the continued journey.” When asked who will start at quarterback, McDaniel said, “I’m pretty sure I know who it is, but I want to make sure after this practice, I think we’ll know with absolute certainty. But I need to let the full work week play out before I stamp it.” Tagovailoa returned to Dolphins practice earlier this week after an extended layoff from his most recent concussion, which he suffered September 12 in a Week 2 game against the Buffalo Bills. He had been placed on the injured reserve list and was eligible to return to play this week provided he cleared protocol. The Dolphins went 1-3 without their signal caller, as the offense averaged a league-low 8.75 points per game during his absence. Tagovailoa’s concussion last month came when he dove for a first down and took ahitfrom Bills safety Damar Hamlin. Tagovailoa was able to walk off the field under his own power after the collision. The Miami QB told reporters Monday he’s been symptom-free since the day after the injury. McDaniel was asked Wednesday why Tagovailoa was placed on the injured reserve list if the quarterback said he was symptom-free. “We maximized the amount of experts that their expertise is the brain and the head and we do everything we can to make sure all those things are available,” McDaniel told the press. “The medical experts are advising you to do one thing. The whole issue was he needed time to rest for that injury.” Tagovailoa said Monday he will not wear aGuardian Cap, a soft-shell helmet covering, saying it’s “a personal choice.” He does wear the VICIS ZERO2 MATRIX ID QB helmet, the team previously has told CNN. That helmet,accordingto the NFL and NFL Players Association, is the safest helmet for quarterbacks. On Monday, Tagovailoa addressed the subject of people’s concerns that he may get hurt again. “I appreciate your concern,”Tagovailoa said to reporters. “I really do. I love this game and I love it to the death of me. That’s it.” A day before Friday’s announcement that Tagovailoa had been cleared, Dolphins offensive coordinator Frank Smith was asked about how the 26-year-old quarterback’s return would help in his job. “I think his return – just the familiarity with two years, knowing how he plays, knowing how his preparation, everything that goes into his ability on game day,” Smith said Thursday. “I just think when you have a guy that has been such a leader for us and such a big part of our offense, obviously it’s great to have one of our captains and our leaders back in the mix and we’re excited for Sunday.”",Miami
81,Trump was doing historically well among Hispanic voters before Madison Square Garden rally backlash,"Donald Trump’s Sunday rally atMadison Square Gardenin New York City featured numerous instances ofspeakers making racist or bigoted remarks. Perhaps none more notoriously so than comedian Tony Hinchcliffe’s offensive comments about Puerto Rico. What makes those remarks – which the former president’s campaign has sought to distance itself from – so noteworthy is they come at a time when Trump seems to be making inroads with Hispanic voters. In fact, he seems to be on his way to doing better with this group than any GOP presidential nominee sinceGeorge W. Bush in 2004. Consider an average of recent polling data on Hispanic voters:Kamala Harrisis ahead of Trump by just 13 points. That’s well off an average of post-election and exit poll datafrom 2020, whenJoe Bidencarried Hispanic voters by 26 points. What’s remarkable is that this 26-point deficit, itself, was an improvement for Trump from 2016. Trump lost Hispanic voters by 39 points to Hillary Clinton, according to an average of exit poll and post-election data. The polling data and 2020 outcome represent a big reason why the Trump campaign has made a concerted effort to win over more Hispanic voters. It helps to explain why the former presidentheld a massive rallyin the heavily Hispanic Bronx earlier this year andvisited a barbershopin that same New York City borough this month. Trump’s improvement with Hispanic voters also helps to explain the current electoral map. Harris’ best path to securing the 270 electoral votes needed to win seems to run through theGreat Lakes battlegroundsof Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. She has been basically even with Trump in polling of these states, if not running slightly ahead. Meanwhile, in Arizona and Nevada, two Southwest battlegrounds with larger Hispanic populations, Trump has been doing well. He has consistently held a margin-of-error advantage in Arizona surveys. In fact, it’s been Trump’sbest polling stateof any that Biden won in 2020. The polling from Nevada has been limited, but it too has moved more toward the former president than what polling averages indicate in the Great Lakes battleground states. Both Arizona and Nevada havemore Hispanic votersthan any of the other five battleground states, which also include Georgia and North Carolina. Trump has been doing particularly well amongHispanic men, as well as Hispanic voters without a college degree. Will a rally like Sunday’s make a difference in that support? It’s unclear. What is notable, however, is that such rallies hark back more to the rhetoric the Trump campaign used during the 2016 cycle, when he performed far worse with Hispanic voters. Still, I would be hesitant to think too much will change after Sunday. For one thing, most Hispanic voters are not from Puerto Rico, especially in the battleground states. For another, Hispanics are not one-issue voters. According to a recentNew York Times/Siena College poll, the No. 1 issue for Hispanic voters was the economy (29%). That matches the 27% of all likely voters who said the economy was their top issue in deciding their vote this year. Immigration ranked third for all likely voters, at 12%, which, again, mirrors the 15% of likely Hispanic voters who felt the same way. Of course, one could argue that Sunday’s rally could have turned off non-Hispanic voters. We already know that Harris is doing historically well for a Democrat amongWhite college-educated voters. They’re the ones who have been moving most to the left since Trump entered the political scene, in no small part because of his rhetoric. White college-educated voters are of paramount importance to Harris in the suburbs of Philadelphia and Detroit and the areas around Madison, Wisconsin. Given how close the contests in those states are, any movement could make all the difference in the world. If nothing else, the Madison Square Garden rally seems to have focused people’s attention on Trump (seeGoogle searches), but for a negative reason. I doubt the Trump campaign likes that.",Not Found
82,Trump returns to ‘epicenter of everything’ for Madison Square Garden rally,"Donald Trumpis kicking off the final full week of the presidential race Sunday with a rally atMadison Square Garden, betting on his own showmanship as he seeks to fill the iconic venue and create a spectacle that will reach television and phone screens in all seven battleground states. The former president is returning to his hometown of New York City – deep-blue turf that virtually no Republicans expect to win, but where signs of discontent and state and local Democratic leadership struggles could help endangered GOP incumbents hold House seats in the surrounding suburbs. It’s the latest in a line of Trump visits to blue states that has also included a rally inCalifornia’s Coachella Valleythis month, one on Long Island in the summer and a recent stop for an economic forum in Chicago. At each stop, in dehumanizing terms, Trump is laying the blame for crime and growing numbers of migrants at the feet of his Democratic rival, Vice President Kamala Harris. “I will rescue every town across America that has been invaded and conquered,” he said Thursday in Las Vegas. The Madison Square Garden event follows a precedent set by campaigns past. The venue, including its earlier locations, boasts an extensive political history. It has hosted presidents such as Grover Cleveland, Herbert Hoover and Franklin D. Roosevelt, and has welcomed both Republican and Democratic national conventions – most recently the GOP confab in 2004. It was also famously the site of John F. Kennedy’s birthday celebration in 1962, when Marilyn Monroe performed her iconic serenade for the president. Yet, Madison Square Garden’s history isnot without controversy. It has played host to far more divisive events, including the notorious “Pro-American Rally” of 1939, a pro-Nazi gathering organized by the German American Bund and attended by thousands in the lead-up to World War II. Days later, a Communist Party rally filled the arena. In 1968, George Wallace, the onetime segregationist governor of Alabama, pushed a law-and-order message in a speech at the Garden days before the presidential election, where he won nearly 10 million votes and carried five states as a third-party candidate. Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz alluded to that history while in Henderson, Nevada, on Sunday. “Go do your Google on this. Donald Trump’s got this big rally going at Madison Square Garden. There’s a direct parallel to a big rally that happened in the mid 1930s at Madison Square Garden and … and don’t think that he doesn’t know for one second exactly what they’re doing there,” the Minnesota governor said. In response, the Trump campaign attacked Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz and noted that Holocaust survivor Jerry Wartski is attending the rally. “Tim Walz is accusing a Holocaust survivor of attending a Nazi rally. Walz should be ashamed of himself and apologize,” Alex Pfeiffer, Trump campaign spokesman, told CNN. For Trump, Sunday’s event signifies more than just a campaign stop. It’s also an important moment for him personally. The former president has long voiced a desire to take the stage at the Midtown Manhattan landmark. His name will most likely appear on the same kind of marquee that has so often welcomed guests like Billy Joel, Elton John and other legendary entertainers. New York remains a safely blue state, though Trump has privately and publicly said that he thinks he could win it, an idea those in his campaign have acknowledged is far from reality. “We think there’s a chance of winning New York first time since, well, long time, many, many decades. And we think there’s a real chance with what’s going on, with the migrants taking over the city, taking over, the whole state, frankly,” he said on Fox News Radio. Ronald Reagan in 1984 was the last Republican presidential nominee to carry the Empire State. It has also been more than two decades since a Republican won a statewide election in New York – the most recent being former Gov. George Pataki when he won a third term in 2002. However, Republicans have expressed some hope that the event could help bolster vulnerable New York GOP lawmakers vying to hold on to their House seats come November. Several of them joined Trump at a tele-rally Saturday hosted by New York Rep. Elise Stefanik – the No. 4 House Republican – to push early voting. Some also appeared at Trump’s September event at Nassau Coliseum on Long Island. None of them, however, are on the speaker’s list released by the Trump campaign for the Madison Square Garden rally. Sunday’s rally will also serve as one of Trump’s largest fundraisers to date, according to multiple sources familiar with the logistics. Donors have been offered a series of packages, including VIP suites, tickets to an exclusive “pre event” at the venue, backstage passes and photo opportunities. “The Trump campaign is going to make an insane amount of money off this event,” one source familiar with the guest list told CNN. Dozens of Republican lawmakers, allies, donors and celebrities are expected to attend. The Trump campaign said speakers at the rally will include the former president’s running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, tech magnate Elon Musk, former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., House Speaker Mike Johnson, Stefanik, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and former Fox News host Tucker Carlson. A number of popular internet celebrities and rappers have endorsed the former president over the course of the campaign, many of whom are likely to attend Sunday, a source close to Trump told CNN. A source close to Trump said there are systems in place to stop Trump critics from signing up for tickets without any intention of showing up, something some allies expressed concerned over. Though Trump won’t be in one of the seven states – Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin – that both campaigns expect to decide the outcome of the November 5 election, the former president’s aides said they expect Sunday’s rally to draw extensive media coverage. “It’s New York City. It’s the biggest media market in the world,” a campaign adviser told CNN. “It’s the epicenter of everything.” This story had been updated with additional developments.

83,Trump says he’s open to eliminating income taxes and repeats ‘enemy from within’ rhetoric on podcast with Joe Rogan,"Former PresidentDonald Trumpsaid on Joe Rogan’s podcast Friday that he would be open to eliminating income taxes, while pushing his sweeping tariff proposal and praising the economic policies of the late 19th century. While talking about tariffs, Trump was asked by Rogan, “Did you just float out the idea of getting rid of income taxes and replacing it with tariffs?” “Well, OK,” Trump said during the interview on “The Joe Rogan Experience.” Rogan asked, “Were you serious about that?” “Yeah, sure. Why not?” the former president responded. “Because, we, ready, our country was the richest in the, relatively, in the 1880s and 1890s. A president who was assassinated named McKinley — he was the tariff king. He spoke beautifully of tariffs.” “And then around in the early 1900s, they switched over stupidly to frankly an income tax. And you know why? Because countries were putting a lot of pressure on America: ‘We don’t want to pay tariffs, please don’t.’ You know they, believe me, they control our politicians,” Trump said. Trump has repeatedly said he plans to impose anacross-the-board tariff of either 10% or 20%on every import coming into the US, as well as a tariff upward of 60% on all Chinese imports, in a bid to encourage American manufacturing. In the interview, Trump also said he believed what he called “the enemy from within” poses a greater threat to the US than North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un, whom he said he had “no problem with” while president. “I got to know him very well. We had no problem with him. If you have a smart problem, if you have a smart, really the right president, the smart president, you’re not going to have a problem. And I say it to people, we have a bigger problem, in my opinion, with the enemy from within, and it drives them crazy when I use that term. But we have an enemy from within. We have people that are really bad people that I really think want to make this country unsuccessful,” Trump said. Trump has repeatedly argued that there are people within the United States — including Democratic Reps. Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi as examples — who pose a greater threat than foreign adversaries. The interview comes after years of Rogan saying he would not have the former president on his podcast and recent attacks from Trump himself. “I’m not a Trump supporter in any way, shape or form. I’ve had the opportunity to have him on my show more than once. I’ve said no every time. I don’t want to help him. I’m not interested in helping him,” Rogansaid on the Lex Fridman Podcastin 2022. Trump took a jab at Rogan in August after the podcaster praised former independent presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for being “the only one that makes sense to me.” (Rogan later clarified that his praisedid not amountto an endorsement.) “It will be interesting to see how loudly Joe Rogan gets BOOED the next time he enters the UFC Ring??? MAGA2024,” Trumpposted on his Truth Social platformfollowing Rogan’s comments. Roganfirst launchedhis podcast in 2009. In the past three years, “The Joe Rogan Experience” has consistently been the No. 1 podcast across the globe. The show has attracted its fair share of controversy, too, notably coming under fire during the pandemic for Rogan’s skepticismabout Covid-19. Following the taping of the podcast in Texas, Trumpattended a Michigan rally, where he took the stage to speak hours late – a delay that led to hundreds of people leaving the event. Trump said he was late because he had been taping the three-hour podcast with Rogan, which he called “the longest interview I’ve done in my life.” “I’m so sorry, but I got tied up. … I figured you wouldn’t mind so much because we’re trying to win,” he said. Trump, during his remarks, accused Vice President Kamala Harris of being “out partying” and ignoring international turmoil Friday, as the Democratic presidential nomineeheld a rally featuring music superstar Beyoncéin Texas, where she focused her speech on highlighting her defense of reproductive rights.

84,US intelligence assesses Russian operatives behind fake video showing Pennsylvania ballots being destroyed,"US intelligence has assessed that Russian operatives were behind a fake video purporting to show someone destroying mail-in ballots in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, that circulated on social media Thursday. “The IC (Intelligence Community) assesses that Russian actors manufactured and amplified a recent video that falsely depicted an individual ripping up ballots in Pennsylvania, judging from information available to the IC and prior activities of other Russian influence actors, including videos and other disinformation activities,” said a joint statement from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. The agencies said that the video is part of an ongoing Russian effort to “raise unfounded questions about the integrity of the US election and stoke divisions among Americans” in the final days of the 2024campaign. CNN reported earlier Friday that US investigators suspected that Russian operatives were behind the fake video, according to two sources briefed on the matter. The Board of Elections in Bucks County, north of Philadelphia, was quick to debunk the video on Thursday. “The envelope and materials depicted in this video are clearly not authentic materials belonging to or distributed by the Bucks County Board of Elections,” the board said in a statement. The county is crucial in determining whether former President Donald Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris wins the battleground state of Pennsylvania. The video appeared on Thursday afternoon on X and was shared by some users as supposed evidence of voter fraud. But the video was hatched by Russian operatives, according to Darren Linvill, an expert on Russian disinformation campaigns at Clemson University. The video was “created in the style and manner of many previous” videos from a Russian information campaign known as Storm-1516, Linvill told CNN. “More importantly, it appeared for the first time from an account that has originated previous Storm narratives and routinely shares campaign content,” he said. It’s the latest example of suspected foreign influence operations in the closing days of the US presidential campaign as Russia, Iran and China all try to cast doubt on the integrity of US elections, according to intelligence officials. Russian operatives have tried to denigrate Harris’ campaign, Iranians have tried to undercut Trump’s, while China has largely focused on down-ballot races. The same Russian network, Storm-1516, was behind a fake video shared on X this month attempting to smear Democratic vice presidential candidateTim Walz, according to Linvill and experts at Microsoft. US intelligence agencies also attributed the activity to Russia. Patricia Poprik, chair of the Bucks County Republican Party, told CNN that she was flooded with texts and calls about the video. “We decided to put out a statement because so many people were calling us from not just Pennsylvania,” Poprik said. Poprik acknowledged that plenty of Republican voters are already skeptical about whether voting by mail is safe, and she wanted to try to put them at ease. “It’s just scaring voters and it’s not what we want,” she said, “I personally voted by mail. I believe it’s safe.” The Bucks County GOP’s effort to help debunk the video is notable because it comes as other prominent conservative voices across the country have continued to amplify misinformation. The original post of the video has been deleted, but it has constantly been reposted across various social media sites on Thursday and Friday. The network behind the account has been active for years on social media.  CNN has identified at least nine other accounts on Facebook, Instagram, Telegram, Rumble, X, Gettr, Truth Social and Gab, that the group is running. The accounts that were identified as the source of the video all posted it around the same time, around 3:00 p.m. ET on Thursday. Many of the accounts frequently push QAnon-conspiracy messages alongside pro-Trump and anti-Harris content. This headline and story have been updated with additional developments.

85,5 tips to wean yourself off added sugar,"Editor’s note:The podcast Chasing Life With Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the medical science behind some of life’s mysteries big and small. You can listen to episodeshere. (CNN) —Halloween is creeping closer. And with it come thoughts about costumes, pumpkins, ghastly decorations and — of course — candy. Who doesn’t love an excuse to pop fun-size chocolate bars, candy corn, lollipops and other goodies into their mouth all day long? But let’s face it; it’s not healthy to eat that way all the time since almost all these treats are laden withadded sugar. As Americans, our excess sugar consumption unfortunately is not confined to one candy-centered holiday a year. Consuming added sugar has become a part of life, woven into almost every meal. Americans 2 years and older consumeon average 17 teaspoons of added sugar a day, according to the mostrecent government data available. It’s almost three times the upper limit of what organizations such as theAmerican Heart Associationrecommend for women — 6 teaspoons — and almost twice that for men — 9 teaspoons. (Others, such as theUS Department of Agricultureand theWorld Health Organization, have slightly different recommendations.) Research continues to pile up that eating too much added sugar can lead to a plethora ofhealth problems, such as weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart and liver disease, cancer and even depression. This love affair with sugar is not entirely our fault; the system is rigged against us, according to one expert. “If you’re one of the unfortunate people that really struggles with craving and compulsion around sugar, you’re stuck in a food environment that is constantly feeding you cues: Eat sugar, eat sugar,” Dr. Laura Schmidt told CNN Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta recently on his podcast Chasing Life. You can listen to the podcast’s full episodehere. Schmidt is a sociologist and a professor of health policy in the School of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. She’s also the lead investigator atSugarScience,a clearinghouse for scientific evidence about sugar and its impact on health under the auspices of UC San Francisco. Schmidt said she doesn’t think people should vilify sugar but they do need to reduce how much they eat. “There’s a problem in the way that we talk about food and nutrition, which is that we focus on single ingredients or single nutrients,” she said. “From a health standpoint, that’s not what matters. What matters is the whole diet; what matters is having all of the macronutrients in a relatively good balance.” However, Schmidt added that Americans are “way over the limit” on sugar. “And we really need to be thinking about ways to dial that particular ingredient down,” she said. But as many know, it’s not always easy to cut back on sugar because it lurks in so many foods, from the obvious (sodas, cakes and candy) to the more subtle (breakfast cereals, bread, yogurt and tomato sauce). By some estimates, added sweeteners are in74% of packaged foodssold in supermarkets. The reason why added sugar wound up in so many of food items is pretty straightforward, Schmidt said. “The food companies have three ingredients that they can use to make food more palatable — some people say hyper-palatable, so extremely attractive to consumers — and that’s sugar, fat and salt,” she said. “And, pretty much, they vary the combination of sugar, fat and salt in most of ourultraprocessed foods. And often they’re put in there because the industrial food production process kind of makes stuff taste bad.” Breaking up with sugar can be hard to do. Schmidt has five tips to tame your intake. Avoid liquid sugar, Schmidt said. “Focus on reducing or cutting out sugar-sweetened beverages, such assodas, sports drinks, energy drinks, fake juice pouches,” she said via email. “These are by far thelargest sourceof added sugars in the American diet, especially for children, and have no nutritional value.” Schmidt noted that liquid sugar can easily become a habit that leaves you consuming large amounts without really noticing. Reduce sugar cues in your work environment. “Encourage your employer or work unit to join others that have stopped selling sugary drinks in vending machines and cafeterias at work,” Schmidt said, adding that these can be replaced with the “many delicious non-sugar alternatives.” “Clinical trials showthat when employers stop selling sugary beverages, regular soda drinkers lose, on average, a half inch in their waist circumference within 10 months,” Schmidt said, adding thatSugarScienceprovides free materials to help workplaces reduce the availability of those beverages. And while you’re at it, maybe take the long way around the candy bowl in the common area, so you don’t hear it calling your name. Don’t forget to clean up your home food environment, too. “Agree as a household not to have sugary junk foods and beverages around — have them when you go out instead, but not as staples at home,” Schmidt recommended. “Studies show that sugar reduction is best done in groups, not alone. So, make a reasonable plan together for what you will and won’t have lying around in the kitchen.” Even if eliminating sugary junk food and soda at home is not enough to stop you from thinking about them, doing so will give you time to resist your impulse to indulge. Have a plan for dealing with the psychological stress of sugar withdrawal. “Sugar cravings are very real. And there are easily learned, evidence-based strategies for coping with them,” Schmidt said. “They rely on cultivating the simple art of experiencing the craving in a relaxed state without acting on it — called ‘surfing the urge.’” There are free “surfing the urge” guided meditations online. Schmidt also points toself-led audio resourcesthat SugarScience uses to help soda drinkers quit who are participating in a 16-site, National Institutes of Health-funded randomized clinical trial. Save sugary foods for desserts; don’t allow them to creep into every part of your diet. “Adult women should confine themselves to less than 6 teaspoons of added sugar daily, 9 teaspoons for men, 4 teaspoons for children, and no added sugars for children under 2,”  Schmidt said via email. One way to control the intake of added sugars, Schmidt said, is to make desserts and treats yourself. “This means enjoy the sugar that you do eat by baking together and savoring together, making the (added) sugar that you do eat part of celebrating life,” she said. Sticking as closely as possible to these guidelines means scrutinizing food labels. Look for the line that shows you the “added sugar” content in a food to tally up the grams of excess sugar you consume in a day. We hope these five tips help you reset your sugar consumption.

86,What all those sexy Halloween costumes are doing to kids,"One of the top Halloween costumes for kids this year, Red from the movie “Descendants: The Rise of Red,” is frequently sold by retailers as a short, tight red getup with lace or fishnet material and zippers. Another onGoogle’s annual “Frightgeist” list of the top 10 kids’ costumes,the Queen of Hearts, often resembles a French maid costume. “Boys are dressing up as military personnel, policemen, and explorers,” Sharon Lamb and Lyn Mikel Brown wrote in the 2006 book “Packaging Girlhood: Rescuing Our Daughters From Marketers’ Schemes.” “Girls dress up as hot little teenagers.” Lamb and Mikel Brown said girls dressing as “princesses, cheerleaders, and sexy divas” was a big change from their childhoods. When the authors were growing up, Halloween was about pretending to be someone or something else for the holiday. But rather than helping girls explore identities such as doctors or scientists — or even superheroes like boys — these days costumes often sexualize girls. It’s part of a broader trend. When girls join social media, they soon realize that an easy way to rack up likes and attention is to make themselves look “hot” in pictures that they post. But it’s a terrible idea at Halloween or any time of year. If a girl wants a sexy Halloween costume, it’s best not to be judgmental but instead to open a dialogue, Elizabeth Baron, a New York City-based psychotherapist and founder ofWith Elizabeth, a platform for moms, said via email. “Parents should explain that dressing in provocative ways leads to the objectification of girls and women, which puts a priority on their bodies and diminishes their other qualities,” Baron said. “When this objectification happens, they are at risk of being mistreated, disrespected, and even abused or violated — whether that’s in person or over the internet.” If they post these photos publicly, they could even attract the attention of child predators.Pediatricians recently warnedthat some children who are sexually assaulted connect with their attackers on social media. Sexualizing themselves is also a sign that girls could think their appearance is of primary importance. “Girls who dress in sexy ways might start to over-identify with their sexuality and believe that their physical appearance is what gives them self-worth,” Baron warned. “When girls become preoccupied with their external appearance, they are more likely to struggle with body image as well as mental health issues such as anxiety and depression and low self-esteem.” While it’s OK for kids to care about how they look, “we want girls and young women to find a balance between taking pride in their appearance andfocusing on the other areas of their identity that contribute to their self-esteem, such as being a good student, a strong athlete, a kind friend, and a responsible daughter,” Baron said. It’s therefore important to teach kids that their confidence shouldn’t be tied to how they dress. “If a child requires a particular outfit on them in order to be confident, it means they aren’t confident,” saidJustine Ang Fonte, a New York City-based sexuality educator. It can be helpful to use examples to drive this point home. “Beyoncé is confident in sweats and a turtleneck because that’s not what makes her sexy — it’s her genuine belief that she has purpose, skill and belonging,” Fonte pointed out. Baron said it’s also important to talk about the pressure kids may feel to make themselves look “hot” if it’s the norm among their friends. “Acknowledge that it can be hard to make different choices than some of their peers,” she said. Parents can also help kids use their imaginations to try on more empowering identities with their costumes. “Fantasy for children is about trying on new roles, about imagining the unusual or impossible, about wearing whatever wild and crazy identity suits their fancy or captivates them at the moment,” Lamb and Mikel Brown wrote in their book. So, parents can encourage girls — and, indeed, kids of all genders — to be things such as Supreme Court justices or president of the United States. “Imagine that anything is possible,” Lamb and Mikel Brown advised. “If her heart is set on glitter, at least help her imagine a feisty fairy who takes on the magical realm’s evil dragon, a butterfly that saves the insect world, or a princess who can use a map to find her own way to the ball.”",Not Found
87,More straight couples are calling each other partner. Here’s why,"Within a year of dating, 31-year-old Siara Rouzer crossed a major relationship milestone. The guy she was seeing was no longer a boyfriend but her partner. Rouzer said the title change was more than semantics to them. It symbolized their equal commitment to building a life together. People in the LGBTQIA+ community often use the word partner to describe their relationship to other parties. While heterosexual couples in theUKand elsewhere have used it for years, experts have noticed more long-termheterosexual couplesin the US adopting the gender-neutral term as well. “I rarely hear somebody say, ‘This is my husband or my wife or my girlfriend,’ it’s already becoming more normalized to say partner,” said Dr. Patricia S. Dixon, a psychologist and professor at National Louis University in Florida.Millennials and Gen Zers on social media use it as a show of support for inclusivity and to normalize the growing number of non-traditional relationships. The shift in language reflects younger generations’ move away from traditional relationship structures. They are more open to exploring gender-fluid, non-monogamous relationships and ones where marriage is not the end objective. Like many couples, Rouzer found “boyfriend” an inaccurate description of her close companion. “My person was 30, and he isn’t a boy. Boyfriend started to feel weird,” she said. “This is a grown man who’s paying taxes.” Referring to someone as your boyfriend or girlfriend suggests several things about your relationship, said Leah Carey, a sex and relationship coach and podcast host of “Good Girls Talk About Sex.” The term implies the relationship is still in the beginning stages of getting to know someone and their compatibility. Those queries have likely been answered for most long-term relationships. “Boyfriend gives a sense of it being short-term and still trying to figure things out with,” Carey said. “I’ve been with my ‘boyfriend’ for 10 years, and it no longer felt like that’s a solid enough term for a person who is a long-term partner.    ” A partnership implies an alternative to marriage while maintaining the same commitment to sharing a life together, said Domenique Harrison, a marriage and family therapist in California. She explained that having a ‘partner’ carries more weight as the relationship dynamics shift from dating to a deeper relationship. Carrying the boyfriend/girlfriend label implies the goal of getting married. Carey explained that “the relationship escalator” is a concept where couples are expected to follow several steps in a romantic relationship. Boyfriend and girlfriend are the first steps on the relationship escalator, and eventually, they move up to fiancé and spouse. This title would, therefore, not apply to unmarried couples metaphorically stepping off the relationship escalator when mutually deciding to live together long-term. The 2018United States Censusreported that young adults cohabitating with an unmarried partner increased while marriage rates dropped. About 15% of adults between ages 25 and 34 cohabitate with an unmarried partner — a 12% increase from 10 years earlier. “More people are realizing they can have a fulfilling, meaningful lifetime partnership with a person that does not need to include a marriage, house or kids,” Carey said. “A lot of people use partners now because it is an opportunity for us to equalize that any type of partnership has value,” Harrison said. “The world has always put more stake in the transition from boyfriend to husband, but you can have worth in a partnership whether it’s one or 20 years.” For Rouzer, “partner” was an appropriate label in her relationship because it tells people they are equal teammates navigating the ups and downs of life together despite choosing not to marry. For example, when Rouzer needed to move across the country for her post doctoral research a few years ago, it was an easy decision for her partner to follow. “It’s an insane choice to move for love, but he moved with me, and I was very happy,” she said. “Partner” became a popular term to use in the LGBTQIA+ communities to denote a romantic relationship is serious, said Harrison. With growing discrimination from the AIDS epidemic and the lack of marriage equality decades ago, people opted to use the term “partners” to protect their status while still honoring their relationship. By normalizing the use of “partner,” Harrison said heterosexual couples are actively supporting LGBTQIA+ relationships. The designation also supports your partner’s gender identity if they are not heterosexual despite being in a straight-identifying relationship. Dixon said people who are bisexual face challenges in relationships because many people wrongly assume it is a phase. “You’re always going to be assumed to be whichever orientation you are currently representing in that moment,” said Carey. “When somebody who is bisexual can say ‘this is my partner,’ it does not lock them into choosing one gender as their only attraction,” added Dixon. Right now, there’s no official term for describing someone who’s more than a boyfriend/girlfriend but not a legal spouse. Calling someone your lover is too intimate. A domestic partner or significant other may sound overly formal. Even the term “partner” could feel ambiguous since people might not know if you’re talking about a life or business partner. For Rouzer, “partner” is the most appropriate label for her nine-year relationship. It’s a term mutually decided in the relationship, and people are more accepting of it than they were years ago, though she still gets the occasional eyebrow raise from strangers. “All the people in my life are very comfortable with my use of the terminology, including the person for whom I use it,” she said. “Isn’t that all that matters?”",Global
88,"How long can you stand like a flamingo? The answer may reflect your age, new study says","It’s a stance flamingos and other feathered species usually take, but seeing how long you can balance on one leg can be a good test of your health, according to a new study. By testing how long people ages 50 and older could hold a one-legged stance, researchers found that the amount of time in which a person can stand on a dominant and nondominant leg significantly decreased with age — and had a larger decline than gait and muscle strength. The study was published Wednesday in the journalPLOS One. Standing on one leg “is a good measure of your overall health system because balance reflects how the body’s systems are working together,” said senior author Dr. Kenton Kaufman, a research scientist and the W. Hall Wendel Jr. Musculoskeletal Research Professor at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. “Good balance provides the ability to carry out activities of daily living without the fear of falling, and this leads to improved quality of life and healthy aging,” he added. The study of 40 participants — all in similarly good health with no neuromuscular disorders — found that the amount of time one could hold a one-legged stance declined at the rate of 2.2 seconds per decade in the nondominant side and at the rate of 1.7 seconds per decade in the dominant side for both men and women when controlling for body size. Previous researchhas found that the ability to balance declines with age. The new study compared this ability with other muscular factors such as hand grip and knee strength as well asgait speed. While all the measurements declined with age — the dominant grip strength declined at a rate of 3.7% and knee strength declined at a rate of 1.4% per decade — the ability to balance while holding a one-legged stance deteriorated at the fastest rate. Balance is important for injury prevention, and those who are unable to balance on one leg for more than five seconds could be at risk of falling more, Kaufman said. Separately, aJune 2022 studyfound that the ability to balance is linked to a longer life, with an 84% higher risk of death from any cause for people unable to stand on one leg unsupported for 10 seconds. A good rule of thumb is to be able to hold the stance for about 30 seconds or longer for those 69 and younger, about 20 seconds for those 70 to 79 and 10 seconds for those older than 80, he added. Doing a one-legged test does not require any special equipment and can be easily done at home, making it an easy health check to perform, Kaufman said. For those unable to stand on one leg for long, it could be a symptom that they have a health condition, such as a cardiac problem or a brain or nervous system issue such as a stroke, dementia or Parkinson’s disease, according to Kaufman. It could also be a sign someone is experiencing side effects from medication. If someone is unable to stand on one leg for more than five seconds, Kaufman recommends making an appointment with a physician. While the study only looked at adults 50 and older, the one-legged test is also “applicable to younger people in that, you know, you want to protect what you have,” Kaufman said. “If you continue to train your balance system as you’re young, you should maintain that as you age.” People of all ages should be physically active and work on their strength and balance because doing so will help in achieving healthy aging, said Dr. Anat Lubetzky, an associate professor of physical therapy at New York University and director of the university’s doctoral program in rehabilitation sciences. Lubetzky was not part of the study. “Balance is essential for many different tasks and we should work on all of them — walking while talking, turning (your) head, quick turns, catching something, walking in the dark, walking on different surfaces … and how to get up and down from a fall,” Lubetzky said in an email. “If we practice standing on one leg, we’ll get better at standing on one leg. That’s great but it’s not going to solve all balance problems and fall risk that happen with aging. … People should work on all aspects of balance — static, dynamic and overall strength, including but not limited to standing on one leg.” Toimprove your balance, Lubetzky recommends fitness or balance classes, such as yoga classes, that usually aim for about 30 or 60 seconds of balance on each leg. Another quick and easy exercise is to put a sock on when standing on a single leg without rushing and without falling on both sides, she added.",Not Found
89,What experts say about taking psilocybin as an alternative treatment for depression,"The matchup: Two doses ofpsilocybin, the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms,” against a six-week course of the popular antidepressant escitalopram, oftensold as Lexapro or Cipralex. Escitalopram is one of a class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. The projected winner: The drug that produces the best outcome at six months in the battle against depression, which affects more than300 million peopleworldwide. The stakes are high for psilocybin clinical trials — there’s a pressing need for a more effective medical solution in the fight against depression, especially treatment-resistant depression. Of the nearly 9 million people with major depression in the United States who have tried pharmaceuticals,2.8 million are estimatedto be resistant to multiple antidepressants. “I am aware of a case of a person who tried 17 different drugs and nothing worked,” said psychobiologist Dr.Bertha Madras, director of the Laboratory of Addiction Neurobiology at Harvard Medical School’s McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. “Even shock therapy failed,” Madras said. “It’s a terrible thing when you simply cannot help a person to get up out of bed and engage in life.” For a good number of people antidepressants have been a blessing, at least at the beginning of treatment,said Dr. Charles Raison, a professor of psychiatry and human ecology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison. “I always start by saying, ‘Thank God, we have them.’ Many people can say, ‘Wow, I was pulled out of a pretty deep hole,’“ said Raison, who is also the director of the Vail Health Behavioral Health Innovation Center in Colorado where psilocybin is studied. But for up to a third of depressed patients, antidepressants fail to work at all. Even for those who do find relief, “the benefits tend to fade in some fairly reasonable percentage of people over time,” Raison added. “Then there’s the side effects, many of which don’t get much better long term.” Initial reactions such as nausea or headaches often fadewithin a few weeksafter starting an antidepressant, but sexual side effects such as reduced libido and difficulty with orgasm can last for months or even years. Inrare cases, sexual dysfunction can persist even after stopping the antidepressant. That’s one problem that psilocybin doesn’t have, said psychedelics researcher David Nutt, director of the neuropsychopharmacology unit at Imperial College London’s division of brain sciences. “If you have just one trip and get better, there’s no drug in you day after day and no long-term sexual side effects,” Nutt said. Psilocybin also has the edge when it comes toemotional blunting,which is the tendency of antidepressants to diminish not only depression but also enjoyment in life. “This is such a consistent finding in studies, it’s become the theory of how antidepressants work — they suppress the brain’s supersensitive stress center and allow it to heal,” Nutt said. “However, the pleasure center of the brain can also be dampened, and we know that because when we put people on antidepressants in the brain scanner, they don’t respond as much as to happy faces,” he added. “Some people don’t like that. They say, ‘I don’t enjoy life as much. I’m not depressed anymore, but I’m not as happy.’” In the search for a new alternative in treatment, psilocybin entered the ring as a fan favorite — arguably the most popular of a lineup of psychedelic drugs that last saw their heyday in theTimothy Leary eraof the 1960s. In small clinical trials, synthetic versions of the psychedelic have shown benefits in tacklingcluster headaches,anxiety,anorexia,obsessive-compulsive disorderand various forms ofsubstance abuse. Still, psilocybin’s highest accolades have come from the drug’s apparent success in treating depression. Three versions of synthetic psilocybin have received the US Food and Drug Administration’s “breakthrough therapy” designation — in 2018 for treatment-resistant depression, which is diagnosed when people have tried and failed multiple antidepressants — and in 2019 and 2024 for clinical depression, diagnosed when a person isseverely depressedmost of the time. Breakthrough status is a designation that can fast-track the road to FDA approval and is given to drugs that “demonstratesubstantial improvementover available therapy,” according to the agency. Another key contender, MDMA, or 3,4-Methyl​enedioxy​methamphetamine, commonly known as Molly or Ecstasy, showspromisein treating post-traumatic stress disorder, or PTSD, but hasn’t been directly studied for depression. In 2024,lysergic acid diethylamide, better known as LSD, won FDA breakthrough status for treating anxiety. It’s also inclinical trialsfor depression.Smallerclinical trials forless well-knownpsychedelics arealso underway. Not everyone in the field is convinced that psilocybin — or any other psychedelic — will survive FDA scrutiny. In August, the agency surprised researchers byrejecting MDMAas a treatment for PTSD, sending its maker back to conduct another clinical trial that could take years. “We have no idea how these drugs will fare in a much larger population of people,” said Harvard’s Madras. “To say that psilocybin is going to be the magic bullet that will solve the problems of depression, I think, is irresponsible at best and hazardous at worst.” Psilocybin works on a different part of the brain than antidepressants, expert says. The psychedelic zeros in on the brain’s ruminative area, where thoughts run in a circular wheel of negativity many find hard to stop. Brain scans taken before, during and after people are tripping on psilocybin show the brainbecomes desynchronized—disrupting those negative thoughts and allowing people to see themselves differently. “People begin to feel, understand and appreciate that their brain can change and they can escape from their depression,” Nutt said. “They can look through a door to a different way of thinking, and they can then walk through the door afterwards.” Integrating those new insights into daily behavior that lasts, however, is the key to long-term success in fighting depression, experts say. That’s why studies on psilocybin have used trained therapists during the hallucinogenic trip, along with therapy sessions before and after the experience. “The psychedelic experience opens up this sort of critical period where your brain is more open, sprouting new brain cells, somewhat like a child’s brain,” Raison said. “But what if you get in a car wreck or your husband leaves you the next day? What if it alters your mental status in ways that make you want to fly so you jump off a bridge? It doesn’t happen often, but that’s the risk.” Psychedelic therapists sometimes do reportadverse outcomes,such as difficulty adapting to life post-treatment and a worsening of anxiety and ruminative brooding, the very conditions psychedelics are supposed to help. Even if such reactions are rare, Raison said, they point to the larger problem of prescribing psilocybin — or any other psychedelic — to the general population. “Let’s say only 2% or 3% of people get really screwed up after a trip,” he said. “If you have 20 million people doing a trip, it’s a problem. These agents are really powerful.” The originalApril 2021 studypitting psilocybin against escitalopram was a double-blinded, randomized controlled trial of 59 patients with either moderate or severe depression. Thirty patients were treated with two 25-milligram doses of psilocybin administered three weeks apart, while the other 29 received one tiny 1-milligram dose of psilocybin along with a six-week course of escitalopram. Both groups received about 20 hours of psychotherapy. “This is the first time anyone has looked at the longer-term behavioral effects of psilocybin compared to something else — and probably the only time anyone will ever do a long-term comparison of psilocybin to an SSRI,” said Raison, who was not involved in the study. “For that reason alone, this research matters.” At six weeks, the study found no significant difference in depression scores between the antidepressant and psilocybin groups. Brain scans, however, showed a different story. “The brains of people on psilocybin had increased flexibility, a greater ability to switch between different brain states,” said Nutt, who was a coauthor on the study. Nutt and his team published the six-month results of the same group of patients inSeptember. While both psilocybin and escitalopram showed comparable improvement in depressive symptoms, people who took psilocybin reported greater joy in their lives — a significant plus in keeping depression at bay. “Psilocybin outperformed escitalopram in several measures of well-being — meaning in life, work and social functioning,” said lead researcher Tommaso Barba, a doctoral candidate at Imperial College London in a statement. However, critics pointed out that people in the psilocybin arm of the trial were allowed to seek out additional therapy and even start antidepressants between the administration of psilocybin and the six-month check-in — behaviors that could have also contributed to improvement. Regardless, the study found people who responded best to psilocybin on brain scans at six weeks reported the lowest levels of depression at six months, Nutt said. “The more flexible a patient’s brain was three weeks after one trip, the better their outcome on depression at six months,” Nutt said. “There’s a biological, physiological change in the brain as a result of psilocybin — which you can see at three weeks after a trip — that predicts clinical outcome. “But before we say it’s a fact, it needs to be replicated,” Nutt added. Harvard’s Madras and other critics said a good deal about psilocybin and other psychedelics must be sorted before any could ever become a new treatment option for mental health. “For one, clinical trials have focused on a restricted population. In some of the studies, 1,000 people are interviewed, and 50 are selected,” said Madras, who wasn’t involved in the escitalopram study. “Why? Because they have to screen out people who might be susceptible to a psychotic break — anyone with family history of suicide, psychosis or bipolar disorder,” she said. In fact, Madras said, adverse effects are such a concern that researchers in psychedelic clinical trials often actively recruit people who have successfully taken psychedelics in the past. Then there’s the issue of blinding. In gold standard randomized clinical trials, patients are not supposed to know if they received a drug or a placebo, a fake pill designed to mimic the active ingredient in the treatment being tested. If a drug is significantly more helpful than the placebo, that’s a good indication the positive effect isn’t due to a patient’s expectation of getting better and the clinical trial is a success. However, finding a placebo that fools people into thinking they are on a hallucinogenic trip has proven challenging. In a study using psilocybin for alcohol substance abuse, for example, some 95% of those involved correctly guessed whether they weretaking psilocybin or the placebo. Then there’s the issue of cost. It’s yet to be determined if the intense therapy needed to bolster success with a psychedelic drug such as psilocybin will be affordable to the many depressed people who need it, Raison said. “That’s the $1,000 question: How will this be brought to scale, and who will pay for it?” he said. “What’s it going to take for insurance to cover a treatment that’s administered say, two to three times a year that might cost $15,000 versus generic Prozac (fluoxetine), which costs five bucks a month? “It is clear psychedelics work and have protracted benefits that we don’t yet understand,” Raison added. “But how that’s going to translate into long-term effectiveness against depression and how the health care system might deliver these at scale is still unknown.”",Global
90,Apple debuted AI on the iPhone today. Here’s what to look out for,"Apple Intelligencelaunched on Monday, but the rollout is just a glimpse of how Apple hopes to transform its products with artificial intelligence. The tech giant unveiled initial features of Apple Intelligence — its suite of AI tools — on select devices with its latest software update for iPhones, iPads and Macs. Apple’s AI features for iPhones will be available for free to users with any iPhone 16, iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, who update to iOS 18.1. Apple Intelligence is also available for iPad and Mac models that support iPadOS 18.1 and macOS Sequoia 15. With Apple Intelligence, the company is implementing its first set of generative AI tools that aim to change how people use their iPhones and cement Apple’s stake in the AI race against competitors like Microsoft and Google. Generative AI is the technology that produces unique text and images in response to user-prompts — fromobscure imagestorelentlessly catchy music. The release of Apple Intelligence comes on the heels of theiPhone 16 releasein September, which is equipped with chip hardware designed to support Apple’s AI-powered features. A pivot to AI has been a focus for Apple since it firstunveiledthe suite of Apple Intelligence features at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference in June. Implementing new generative AI is at the forefront of Big Tech ambitions to maintain exponential growth, and after years of sluggish sales, Apple is betting on AI to boost its performance and reinvigorate its consumer base. The Apple Intelligence features rolling out Monday include improvements to writing and editing, Siri and the Photo app. Apple Intelligence’s Writing Tools bring users improved proofreading, summarizing and editing features. Another focus of the release is Siri, which is supposed to become “more natural and conversational” with Apple Intelligence, and will appear as a glowing light when activated. With the software update, Apple says the Photos app is “more intelligent,” with the ability to search for photos and videos by typing visual descriptions, like what someone was wearing. Users will also be able to edit photos and remove unwanted visual elements with another new feature called Clean Up. Additionally, users will be able to record and transcribe calls, with Apple Intelligence providing a summary. Apple Intelligence’s features most likely fit into the“nice to have” categoryrather than necessary features most new phone buyers actively seek, however. Angelo Zino, a technology analyst at CFRA Research,told CNN in Septemberthat “you need to wait for word of mouth to trickle through the consumer base over the next couple of quarters” before consumers will see the value of the new technology. And Apple’s loyal customers or AI-curious consumers who were intrigued by images of Apple’s new AI-generated “Genmoji” may feel underwhelmed by this launch, as many new features, like Image Wand — which lets users turn sketches into AI-generated images — won’t be available until at least December, when iOS 18.2 debuts. While the first set of Apple Intelligence features might leave some iPhone users wondering if that’s all there is to it, some analysts are bullish on Apple’s plan to implement AI across its products, largely thanks to the company’s large position in the market. Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities, said in a note Sunday that the rollout is the start of what will be an evolving process. “Consumer AI will go through Apple’s ecosystem with over 20% of the world’s population ultimately interacting with AI on an Apple device the next few years,” Ives said. Apple is betting big on AI to boost its sales, and the rollout followsthe iPhone 16 release, which didn’t initiallysell aswell as Apple may have hoped. Apple sold just an estimated 37 million units in the first weekend of iPhone 16 pre-sales,down more than 12% compared to the same period last year, according to ablog postfrom Ming-Chi Kuo, an Apple analyst with TF International Securities. Additionally, Apple recently cut orders for iPhone 16s by about 10 million units through the end of 2024 and into 2025, according to another blog post byKuo. That cut will result in less production of iPhones, he noted. According to Kuo, iPhone production for the fourth quarter of 2024 is now forecast at around 80 million, down year-over-year from 84 million. Kuo noted that he did not think Apple Intelligence would immediately boost Apple’s prospects for better sales. “Some market participants are optimistic that Apple Intelligence could dramatically boost iPhone shipments soon,” Kuo said in the blog post. “However, Apple’s recent order cuts suggest this optimistic expectation may not materialize in the short term.” The first rollout of Apple Intelligence features are available on devices with language settings set to American English. The ability to use Apple Intelligence in other languages like French or Japanese will roll out in 2025. Abigger slate of AI features is expected in December when Apple debuts iOS 18.2, inclinding “Genmoji,” a feature that lets users create their own emoji, along with ChatGPT-powered Siri and Writing Tools. Apple is also planning to introduce a “visual intelligence experience” which would allow iPhone 16 users to hover their iPhone camera over objects and retrieve real-time information. Wedbush’s Ives said the implementation of Apple Intelligence will produce positive long-term results for the company. “This will be a multi-year AI journey that will define the future for Apple with its next generation chip architecture, hardware releases and future iPhone models built around the AI foundation that many consumers will ultimately embrace,” Ives said in a note. CFRA Research’s Zino said Apple’s December rollout should prove more impactful than the October release. “We do not expect the Apple Intelligence capabilities rolling out this week to have a notable impact on consumer behavior and Apple-related product sales,” Zino said in an email to CNN. “Planned Apple Intelligence new features expected in December and early 2025 will be much more impactful to the company’s ecosystem, in our view, and will be viewed favorably by Apple’s installed base.” Apple (AAPL) will report its quarterly earnings on Thursday. Shares of Apple on Monday closed at $233.40, a gain of $1.99, or 0.86%.",Global
91,X changed its terms of service to let its AI train on everyone’s posts. Now users are up in arms,"When X unveiled its newest terms of service, which go into effect on November 15, users quickly picked up on one change. “By submitting, posting or displaying Content on or through the Services, you grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free license to make your Content available to the rest of the world,” theterms of servicesaid, which includes the right to analyze any of that content “including, for example, for use with and training of our machine learning and artificial intelligence models, whether generative or another type.” Basically, by continuing to use the platform, users will agree that X can use their data to train its AI models. Using content to train AI has become a major issue as the technology booms. On X,artists and others in creative rolesare fretting about their work being used – not just on X – to train computers that could someday replace human creators entirely.OtherX users say they are concerned about personal information in their tweets being used that way. Some users said on the site they have already begundeleting photographs of themselvesfrom their feeds. And if users have any issue with those terms, they may end up in a federal courtroom that isfavored by conservative activistsand is already presiding overtwolawsuitsinvolving Musk-owned X. According to the update, all disputes related to the terms will be brought to the US District Court for the Northern District of Texas or state courts in Tarrant County, Texas. Tarrant County is more than 100 miles away from X’s new headquarters outside of Austin, Texas. X’s terms said any users who continue to use their products or services on or after November 15 would be agreeing to the updated terms. Grok, X’s AI chatbot, has already been embroiled in controversy, fromspreading false informationabout the 2024 election togenerating violent, graphic fake imagesof famous politicians. Companies fromGoogletoMicrosofthave similarlycome under fire for sometimes weird, completely off-baseAI tools. Before the most recent terms of service update, X users couldopt outof sharing data by going to “settings,” then “privacy and safety.” Under the “data sharing and personalization” header, there is a tab for“Grok,”where users can uncheck the box that allows the platform to use their data for AI training. But it’s not clear whether X’s new terms of service take away that option. X can now license all the content on the platform, including using it in its machine learning and artificial intelligence models. While such broad licensing with few limitations is not uncommon for a social media platform, Alex Fink, CEO and founder of Otherweb, an AI-based news reading platform that targets misinformation, told CNN that what makes X unique is that its new terms “remove any ambiguity” in contrast to other platforms that don’t spell out their intentions. Before, X said posts from private accounts would not be used to train Grok. But the language in the new terms of service does not differentiate between the types of accounts. But only time will tell if you may still be able to opt out, despite the new terms. Fink said it’s fairly common for a company’s legal terms to give it more leeway than its own menu options allow.

92,Elon Musk says he’ll fix the government under Trump. His track record paints a different picture,"Elon Musk is making some big promises while campaigning for former President Donald Trump. But his business record calls into question whether he can deliver. Musk and Trump havepublicly discussedsome kind of government role for the Tesla and SpaceX CEO if Trump wins the presidency. Although Musk and Trump haven’t provided any specifics, Musk has jokingly referred to his potential job as leading a Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, the name of Musk’s favorite meme and cryptocurrency. Trump onFox News last weeksaid Musk may serve as the “Secretary of Cost-Cutting,” a government agency that also doesn’t currently exist. If he were to lead some kind of task force, Musk, on the campaign trail and in anAugust X interview with Trump, has promised to recommend steep cuts to reduce wasteful spending that doesn’t benefit Americans, perhaps using AI to determine where to cut. He has also said he’d pitch a massive rollback of government regulations, which has has long griped about. And Musk has promised a gentle touch, offering generous severance packages to laid-off government workers, while at the same time proposing an assessment system that threatens layoffs to wasteful employees. All of those are tactics Musk has employed or promised at his businesses. His track record is mixed. Musk did not respond to a request for comment. Trump, in his interview with Musk in August and in subsequent public discussions about a possible government role for Musk, has praised the CEO for his ruthlessness with layoffs. The UAW autoworkers unionfiled labor chargesagainst the pair in August after Trump called Musk a “cutter” and suggested he would fire striking autoworkers. And Trump, announcing in September his plans for Musk’s possible role, said Musk would make recommendations for “drastic reforms.” When discussing what he might do for the government, Musk said in a Pittsburgh town hall Sunday that major cuts to government spending would be necessary: “Step No. 1 is to spend a lot less of it,” Musk said. “Let’s start from scratch.” But cuts haven’t always worked out so well for Musk’s companies. At X, Musk has made significant layoffs, slashingroughly 80% of the company’s staff. That has led to a janky, unstable product, as evidenced by his disastrous technology failures wheninterviewing Florida Gov. Ron DeSantisin 2023 and Trump a couple of months ago. Musk has alsoeliminated X’s trust and safety teams, leading to an escalation in hate speech and unchecked misinformation — and an advertiser exodus from the platform. X is worth80% less than what Musk bought it forin October 2022, according to Fidelity. Regulations have bugged Musk for years, who has railed against what he has called unnecessary bureaucracy and red tape. That’s not a new complaint among business leaders. What is different is Musk’s approach to skirting or bending of rules, which have at times led to disastrous results. At Tesla, Musk has pushed forward ambitiously in deploying “full self-driving” technology, despite multiple accidents and government warnings and investigations. In a deploy-first-and-fix-it-later approach, Tesla has issued several recalls of the technology, though the company has maintained that automated driver software saves lives. America’s top safety regulator on Friday announced yet another investigation into Tesla after a fatalaccident involving a pedestrianhit by a car using Tesla’s full self-driving features. Last year, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said the technology has “led to an unreasonable risk to motor vehicle safety based on insufficient adherence to traffic safety laws.” And it warned that FSD could violate traffic laws at some intersections “before some drivers may intervene.” And at SpaceX, skirting California government regulators has led tonotoriously unhappy residentsandlawsuitsin a Texas town where the company set up shop to launch and test its massive rockets. Among the complaints are trespassing, broken windows and large debris fields. Musk moved much of SpaceX’s operation out of California to Texas because of too much regulation. And the companysued a California regulatorlast week. Musk suggested offering ousted government employees two years’ severance, according to theWall Street Journal, which attended several of Musk’s rallies for Trump. “The point is not to be cruel or to have people not be able to pay the mortgage,” Musk said Friday. But Musk at X wassued repeatedlyfor failing to make good on his promise to honor laid-off employees’ severance packages — including the former CEO and other major executives, who were denied hundreds of millions of dollars in their exit packages. Before Musk’s purchase of Twitter — now X — in 2022, the company’s severance plan dictated that employees who remained after the acquisition and were subsequently fired would take home up to six months of pay, plus one week of pay for each year they worked for the company. But the lawsuits against Musk and the company claim the company refused that payout. Muskwon one such lawsuitearlier this year but several remain active.",Global
93,Commonwealth leaders say ‘time has come’ for discussion on UK slavery reparations,"Commonwealth leaders, ending aweek-long summit in Samoa, said on Saturday the time had come for a discussion on whether Britain should commit to reparations for its role in the transatlantic slave trade. Slavery and the threat of climate change were major themes for representatives of the 56 countries in the group, most with roots in Britain’s empire, at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting that began in the Pacific Islands nation on Monday. British Prime MinisterKeir Starmer, whose country has long rejected calls for financial compensation for nations affected by slavery, said summit discussions were not “about money.” On slavery, the leaders said in a joint statement they had “agreed that the time has come for a meaningful, truthful and respectful conversation towards forging a common future based on equity.” The push for ex-colonial powers such as Britain to pay reparations or make other amends for slavery and its legacies has gained momentum worldwide, particularly among the Caribbean Community and the African Union. The statement also made reference to “blackbirding”, a term for people from places including the Pacific Islands being deceived, coerced or kidnapped to work on plantations in Australia and elsewhere. Those opposed to reparations say countries should not be held responsible for historical wrongs, while those in support say the legacy of slavery has led to vast and persistent racial inequality. The joint statement did not mention what form reparations should take. Starmer told a press conference the joint statement did two things: “It notes calls for discussion and it agrees that this is the time for a conversation. “But I should be really clear here, in the two days we’ve been here, none of the discussions have been about money. Our position is very, very clear in relation to that,” he said. Professor Kingsley Abbott, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London, said the statement was a sign of a potentially historic breakthrough on the issue. “The commitment to conversations on reparatory justice wedges open the door for dialogue, and now the hard work really begins,” said Abbott, who attended the summit. The joint statement also referred to concern about “the severe consequences of the climate crisis, including rising temperatures and sea levels.” In a boost for Pacific Islands such as Tuvalu under threat from rising seas, they issued the Commonwealth’s first Oceans Declaration, affirming that a nation’s maritime boundaries should remain fixed even if climate change causes small island states to be submerged. Fixing maritime boundaries means atoll nations can continue to reap the economic benefit of vast fishing grounds, even if populations must migrate as dry land area is significantly reduced. The declaration bolsters momentum for international law to recognise the perpetual statehood of sinking island states. More than half of the Commonwealth’s members are small nations, many of them low-lying islands at risk from rising sea levels caused by climate change.",Global
94,Dock tragedy is latest chapter in Gullah Geechee community’s long struggle,"For the young daughters of Michael and Kimberly Wood, it was their first time at the annual festival celebrating the culture of the Gullah Geechee community on Georgia’s remote Sapelo Island, the birthplace of their maternal grandmother and other descendants of enslaved Africans. After a day of storytelling, poetry, religious dance and hope-filled spirituals a week ago Saturday, the Woods, other family members and dozens of festival goers waited on a floating dock and adjoining gangway for the scenic ferry ride to the mainland across marshy Doboy Sound. A loud cracking sound and a sudden shifting of the gangway were the only warning before the relatively newdockside aluminum walkway plunged into the waterabout 60 miles south of Savannah. The collapse killed seven people, injured several others and gave his two girls what Michael Wood said was their first glimpse of the Gullah Geechee community’s longtime heartache and resilience. “It’s that fight to survive,” said Wood, a quality assurance engineer who slid down the collapsed gangway, snatched his 74-year-old mother out of the water and handed her to a stranger on the dock. Wood said he unsuccessfully attempted to reach his 8-year-old daughter Hailey, who was eventually rescued by the boyfriend of a relative as she clung to part of the dock. His wife Kimberly, clinging to their 2-year-old daughter Riley and using a book bag as a flotation device, drifted away in the strong current before another stranger pulled them safely to shore. The October 19 tragedy is the latest chapter in the struggles of one of the last surviving Gullah Geechee communities in the Georgia Sea Islands. These descendants of Africans who were enslaved on coastal plantations in the Southeast have fought to preserve their ways of life amid what they describe as a long-standing policy of neglect by state and county officials. “The call that the community has to its preservation is strong and runs deep, even risking their lives to save a life,” said Joyce White, a professor and interim director of theGullah Geechee Cultural Heritage Centerat Georgia Southern University. “The risk of life, or death in this instance, is for future survival.” Four women and three men, all of them older than 70, were killed in the collapse, which the head of the Georgia Department of Natural Resources said appears to have been caused by a “catastrophic failure of the gangway.” An engineering and design firm will conduct an independent investigation in the cause, the DNR said Friday. Thevictimswere identified as Jacqueline Crews Carter, 75; Cynthia Gibbs, 74; William Johnson Jr., 73; Carlotta McIntosh, 93; Isaiah Thomas, 79; Queen Welch, 76; and Charles L. Houston, 77. They had traveled to the festival from Jacksonville, Florida, Atlanta and Darien, Georgia. Those who died were among 700 visitors to the island for theannual Cultural Day celebration, which residents said used to attract as many as 2,000 people. Only 29 original descendants remain in the small hamlet known as Hogg Hummock or Hog Hammock, where their enslaved ancestors settled after being forcibly brought there in 1802. The state now owns most of the island. As festival goers waited to board a ferry returning to the mainland, the gangway came down. At least 20 people plunged into the Duplin River, officials said. There were as many as 40 people on the walkway at the time. The ferry dock was rebuilt in 2021 after a group of Gullah Geechee residents reached multimillion-dollar settlement with the state over what they claimed in a 2019lawsuitwere soaring property taxes and inferior treatment compared to the residents on the mainland. In 2015 federal civil rights claims, residents said they were payinghigh property taxes and receivinginadequate services including “water, emergency medical, fire, road maintenance, trash, and accessible ferry services to members of the community.” The lawsuit against the state was settled in 2020 and the case against the county was settled two years later. Thestate settlementincluded the construction of the dock and “new aluminum gangways” as well as improved ferry service. “There should be very, very little maintenance to an aluminum gangway like that,” DNR Commissioner Walter Rabon told reporters last Sunday, adding there were “almost daily” visual inspections of the structure. The gangway passed four safety inspections since 2022, DNR said in a statement on Thursday. A subcontractor inspected the structure in May 2022, one day after the agency was “made aware of a loud noise that had been heard by a group on the gangway,” according to the statement. The May 2022 inspection and a follow-up later that year in December both found “no structural concerns with the gangway,” said the agency, which owns and runs the docks and ferries. Two additional inspections were conducted after recent hurricanes Helene and Milton and “no concerns” were identified, the statement said. The cause of the collapse is also being looked at by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Civil rights attorney Ben Crump – who is representing relatives of some victims – as well as a number of island residents have called for a federal probe. A week ago Saturday, Michael and Kimberly Wood, their two daughters, his mother Susie, and several other family members arrived on Sapelo from their homes throughout the state. The barrier island, about 7 miles off the coast of Georgia, is accessible only by boat or ferry. “I wanted my daughters to experience Cultural Day and see where their grandmother grew up,” Michael Wood said. On the way back after the event, however, the gangway collapsed and Wood, 43, said his family got a firsthand look at the resilience and strength of an imperiled community that refuses to go away. “A lot of people that attended the festival jumped into action,” he said. “People were falling into the water and screaming everywhere. And others rushed over from the festival to save anyone that they could.” Video footage from the scene showed people desperately clinging to a section of the walkway, which hung at a steep angle in the water. Others in the water were dragged away by the current. Still, people dove in to help. Some hurled life jackets into the water as survivors drifted away. Wood said he learned from his sister on the shore that his 8-year-old daughter had been rescued. He ran up and down the rugged shoreline, desperately looking for Kimberly and Riley, shouting out their names and fearing the worst. “My heart was just dropping,” he said. His sister, a nurse, performed CPR on a number of people along the way. Eventually, the couple, their daughters and other family members were reunited and tightly held one another with tears in their eyes. “The visitors and everybody at the event jumped in quickly,” said Kimberly Wood, 42, her voice still shaky days after the tragedy. “They basically took over. They were throwing life vests. We drifted very far away and I had to wait for a life vest to float over to me. I’m thankful for all the visitors and the descendants for their quick action. I do not know their names, maybe their faces, but thank you.” J.R. Grovner, 44, who runs an island tour company and had his boat at the dock, said the initial rescue efforts in the first 30 to 45 minutes after the gangway collapse involved mostly locals and festival goers. Vessels and a helicopter from the Coast Guard and DNR appeared later, he said. Others who were there gave similar accounts. “For almost an hour we had hell on Sapelo … and it was being tended to by civilians,” he said. The DNR said other emergency agencies assisted with the deployment of boats equipped with side-scan sonar and helicopters for search and rescue missions. But officials have not released a specific timeline of the those efforts. “This is part of our ongoing investigation. We will provide additional updates as they are made available,” DNR Deputy Commissioner Trevor Santos said in an email Friday. At a news conference after the collapse, Rabon, the DNR commissioner, thanked civilians who took time to help. “Their quick response and action saved additional lives,” he said. Grovner said when he arrived at the dock shortly after the collapse, he noticed someone had loosened his boat, which had drifted away because they had been unable to start its engine. “It was like a horror scene in a movie,” he said, noting that he momentarily attempted to revive a person on the shore. He jumped in the water. Another boater picked him up and delivered Grovner to his own vessel, where he said he found a cousin performing CPR on two people who were already dead. They returned to the dock area and left the two bodies on the shore. Grovner said he then heard his goddaughter yell at him: Her 2-month-old daughter was unconscious after falling in the water. Grovner took the baby into his speed boat. A woman at the scene left her child with one of his relatives and volunteered to give the girl CPR as he raced to the mainland. His goddaughter suffered a fractured knee in the collapse. He left her baby girl in the hands of paramedics on the mainland, he said. She survived. The other day, Grovner recalled, his granddaughter told him she doubts she’ll return to Sapelo. “You don’t want to hear somebody say that when their roots are from the island,” he said. The day of the collapse Grovner eventually returned to the dock area, where he and others covered some bodies with blankets. They also used blankets to carry the injured to boats waiting to transport them to the mainland for emergency care, he said. Reginald Hall, 59, an island native who helped chronicle the claims and organize the residents involved in the lawsuits, joined Grovner at a news conference last weekend. They demanded answers from state and county officials. “What I saw that day was the human fabric pull together and have an opportunity to make every effort they could – we could – to place ourselves not only in the shoes of the people who were suffering, but to place ourselves inside the rescue effort and say, if that were us, we would want the same type of response,” Hall told CNN. White, the Georgia Southern University professor, added: “The Gullah Geechee community has always had to fight for their survival. And the assaults on the culture are unceasing.” CNN’s Dalia Faheid, Ashley R.

95,"The rape claims that tie the Menendez case to Menudo: ‘There might be other victims,’ doc producer says","Erik and Lyle Menendez have always maintained that they killed their parents because they were being sexually abused by their father. New evidencethat may support the Menendez brothers’ allegations - some brought to light in a Peacock docuseries last year - could soon lead to the men leaving prison. The brothers have been serving life sentences for fatally shooting Jose and Kitty Menendez in the family’s California mansion in 1989. Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascónannounced this weekthat he is seeking resentencing, citing aletter allegedly written by Erikto his cousin before the murders in which he referenced being afraid of his father and sworn testimony from Roy Rosselló, a former member of the boy band Menudo, who claims he was raped by Jose – then the head of RCA Records – in the mid-’80s. Rosselló first publicly shared his account in “Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed” in 2023, which prompted calls to reexamine the Menendez brothers’ sentences in light of their abuse claims. “No other young man has ever come forward and said that he was raped by Jose Menendez,” Robert Rand,  a journalist who co-produced the docuseries, told CNN. “We believe that there might be other victims out there and we are hoping that they’ll contact us.” Rand’s project, a recentNetflix documentaryand the series “Monsters: The Lyle and Eric Menendez Story,” all illustrate continued interest in the Menendez case and suggest an evolving societal understanding of sexual abuse, especially for male victims, Rand said. Rosselló recalled in “Menendez + Menudo: Boys Betrayed” that he was 13 years oldwhen he met Jose Menendez. “That’s the man here, that raped me. This guy, that’s the pedophile,” Rosselló said in docuseries as he pointed to a photo of Jose Menendez. He claims he was given wine and passed out before he later woke up in a New York City hotel room and found himself bleeding. “I was in terrible pain for a week. I could barely stand the pain. I couldn’t even move,” Rosselló said tearfully. The Menendez brothers’habeas corpus petition, filed shortly after the docuseries released, cites Rosselló’s allegations. “Jurors never knew that Jose Menendez raped Rosselló a second time in a New York City hotel,” the filing states. “Some of the Menendez supporters were saying, ‘Well, where was Roy Rosselló 30 years ago when the brothers were on trial?” Rand told CNN. “But you have to understand that some people are so ashamed of being abuse survivors, they take that secret to their graves.” Rand and the series’ director, Esther Reyes, said Rosselló, who now lives in Brazil, would testify in Los Angeles, if required by the court. “He’s an incredibly credible witness,” Reyes told CNN. “I interviewed him for hours. He’s very consistent. He’s very clear.” CNN reached out to Rosselló regarding Gascón’s recommendation to resentence the Menendez brothers, but he was not available for comment. “Roy is well aware of what’s happening,” Rand said. “Roy is following all the new developments closely.” Rosselló would also like to speak to Erik and Lyle, according to Rand, who added that the brothers’ legal team does not want them to “meet or have any contact because Roy is a potential witness in a capital murder case.” “Roy has told us that he would very much like to meet the Menendez brothers,” Rand said.",Los Angeles
96,"Military investigation into incident during Trump’s controversial Arlington Cemetery still ongoing, Army report says","A military law enforcement investigation is still ongoing into theincident at Arlington National Cemeterywhen an employee was reportedly pushed by a member of former President Donald Trump’s campaign. An Army spokesperson previously said in August that the service “considers this matter closed.” The Army on Friday released ahighly redactedpolice report filed in August by the employee. “The law enforcement investigation into the incident remains open and we are therefore unable to provide further information at this time,” an Army release including the report said on Friday. The released report says the incident is still being investigated by the Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall Police Department Investigations Branch, though the employee “did not want to press charges.” The report is highly redacted, offering nearly no clarity or detail on what occurred during the incident, though the Army has previously said that the Arlington employee in question was “abruptly pushed aside” by a member of the Trump team. The report was filed against a “simple assault” offense, the report says, though the actual detail of what occurred is redacted aside from the claim appearing to say the individual was pushed with both hands by another individual. The report was released in response toa court orderthat was delivered earlier this week in response to a lawsuit by American Oversight, a nonpartisan watchdog nonprofit advocating for the release of government records. “We’re pleased that American Oversight was able to get the report into the hands of the American public so they can see for themselves that there is still an ongoing federal law enforcement investigation into the August incident at Arlington National Cemetery,” Chioma Chukwu, interim director of American Oversight, said Friday. Trump and his campaign had been at Arlington to attend a ceremony marking three years since the Abbey Gate bombing that killed 13 US service members in Afghanistan during the US’ chaotic withdrawal. Trump attended at the invitation of family members of some of the fallen troops. A video of the visit was later posted by the Trump campaign on TikTok, showing the former president visiting grave sites throughout the cemetery with audio of Trump criticizing the Biden administration’s “disaster” of the withdrawal. Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung at the time disputed claims of a physical altercation taking place, saying the employee “decided to “physically block members of President Trump’s team during a very solemn ceremony.” Cheung suggested that Trump’s team had video to back up the claim, though no video of the incident has been released. Trump campaign manager Chris LaCivita attacked the unnamed individual as “despicable,” saying they were “spreading these lies” and “dishonoring the men and women of our armed forces.” Meanwhile, the visit was criticized by others, including veteran organizations, as an inappropriate politicization of one of the most sacred burial sites for the US military. The US Armyissued a rare rebukein a statement in the days that followed the incident, defending the Arlington employee and saying Trump and his staff “were made aware of federal laws, Army regulations, and DoD policies, which clearly prohibit political activities on cemetery grounds,” including in Section 60, which is largely reserved for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. “This incident was unfortunate, and it is also unfortunate that the ANC employee and her professionalism has been unfairly attacked,” the Army spokesperson said at the time. “ANC is a national shrine to the honored dead of the Armed Forces, and its dedicated staff will continue to ensure public ceremonies are conducted with the dignity and respect the nation’s fallen deserve.” The Trump campaign pointed to a statement from the Gold Star families he accompanied, saying they gave his videographer and photographer permission to be there. Though some imagery from the visit showed the graves of other US service members who families did not give permission. In one photo that was shared online the grave of Army Master Sgt. Andrew Marckesano — a Special Forces soldier and Silver Star recipient who died by suicide — was featured, as it sits next to the grave of Marine Staff Sgt. Darin Hoover, one of the 13 killed at Abbey Gate. Marckesano’s sister, Michele, said in a statement that while they supported the families of the 13 fallen “in their quest for answers” regarding the Afghanistan withdrawal, the Trump campaign “did not adhere to the rules” of Section 60. “According to our conversation with Arlington National Cemetery, the Trump Campaign staffers did not adhere to the rules that were set in place for this visit to SSGT Hoover’s grave site in Section 60, which lays directly next to my brother’s grave,” Michele Marckesano said in a statement in August. “We hope that those visiting this sacred site understand that these were real people who sacrificed for our freedom and that they are honored and respected accordingly.”",Arlington
97,Millions joined a livestream selling tickets to space on a Chinese rocket,"Two tickets for passage on what could be the first Chinese rocket ship to take tourists to space were sold Thursday, according to a livestream held by the company, as the country’s commercial space firms aim to join a small but expanding global space tourism industry. The tickets – priced at 1,000,000 yuan (around $140,000) for a roughly 12-minute trip to the edge of space on a spacecraft set to be launched by Deep Blue Aerospace in 2027 – sold out “immediately,” according to state-linked Global Times. Some 3 million people tuned in to the broadcast on Chinese shopping platform Taobao, which was the first time a Chinese firm has put tickets for space tourism up for public sale. The identities of the ticket buyers were not made available. Deep Blue Aerospace is among a vanguard of Chinese commercial space firms developing rockets to power Beijing’sambitious plans for outer space, which include building outsatellite constellations to rival American firm SpaceX’s Starlink– as China vies to become a dominant space power alongside the United States. Work remains to be done for the company to meet its announced timeline. Deep Blue Aerospace’s reusable Nebula-1 rocket – slated to carry the company’s CEO and five others to space for the mission in three years – is still under development. Last month, the rocket failed to complete a high-altitude vertical recovery test flight, the companysaid, with footage it released showing the vehicle crashing in its final phase. A new test is slated for next month, while the company has said it will ramp up testing in 2025 and 2026 to ensure the “safety and reliability of suborbital manned travel.” Companies working in rocket development across the world have frequently faced setbacks and delayed timelines. But on Thursday, Deep Blue Aerospace’s CEO and founder Huo Liang appeared confident that the rocket would be ready to power the 2027 flight, as he discussed the plans during the ticket sale livestream. Huo explained how passengers can unbuckle their seat belts in space and “move around like fish” in the weightless environment, where they feel “exactly the same lying down as standing up.” “In this experience, you can not only see how the earth is round, but also the vast universe and the blue planet where humans live,” said Huo, who founded the private company in 2016. Deep Blue Aerospace aims to join a small group of companies globally offering what’s considered the next frontier of adventure tourism – typically expensive trips where passengers willing to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars can cross the Kármán line some 100 kilometers (62 miles) above Earth’s surface to enter space. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origincompleted its first commercial human space flight with four private citizens in 2021, while Virgin Galactic, the space tourism venture founded by British billionaire Richard Branson,began offering regular tripsto the edge of space last year. Companies are also looking to expand their offerings to “space tourists.” Last month, a four-person crew of civilians on board SpaceX’s Polaris Dawn missionmade historyas the first group of non-government astronauts to conduct a spacewalk. Deep Blue Aerospace is not the only Chinese firm with a plan to send humans to space. This May, CAS Space said its “space tourism vehicle” will take its first crewed flight in 2028, with tickets priced expected to cost between 2 to 3 million yuan (around $281,000 to $421,000), according to state media. The company is among a number of Chinese state-backed and private firms that are vying to develop reusable rocket technology, which could help make frequent missions to space more affordable and sustainable. Access to reusable rockets could be a key development for China as it seeks to expand its launch capacity to build out satellite constellations and power its ambitious civil space program – as well as build out a space tourism industry. Commentators on the livestream appeared to express some tongue-in-cheek skepticism about sending people to space, with some asking, “(If we go), can we get back?” And those interested in the remaining seats will get another chance, the company’s page on Taobao said, noting that ticket sales will reopen on November 23.",Global
98,Kate Bush is ‘very keen’ to make a new album,"Kate Bushhas said that she is “very keen” to start working on a new album, in a revelation that’ll be met with huge excitement by her legions of fans. In a rareinterviewthat aired Friday, the British singer-songwriter told the BBC’s “The Today Podcast: Bonus Episode” that she has “lots of ideas” for new material. When asked if she was working on any new material, Bush replied: “Not at the moment but I’ve been caught up doing a lot of archive work over the last few years on all kinds of different levels - redesigning our website, putting a lyric book together - and I’m very keen to start working on a new album when I’ve got this finished. “I’ve got lots of ideas and I’m really looking forward to getting back into that creative space - it’s been a long time.” Bush, 66, who shot to fame with the release of her debut hit “Wuthering Heights” in 1978, has not released a studio album since 2011. Nevertheless, the much-loved star gained a new generation of fans in 2022 after her 1985 song “Running Up That Hill” became a huge hit after it was featured in the Netflix series “Stranger Things.” The surge in popularity led to Bush breaking three world records, according to the Guinness Book of World Records. The news came as part of an interview that Bush gave about a short film she’s written and directed to benefit the charityWar Child, which supports children affected by conflict. The four-minute black and white film, called “Little Shrew,” is set to a song called “Snowflake,” which Bush first wrote for her son. “This animation has taken up a lot of time this year so really once this is finished I’ll be ready to start anew,” she said. Although Bush gave very little away, she said she expected that any new output would be “different” from her previous work. “I think it’s got to be different, hasn’t it? I like to think that all my albums are different from each other.” Bush was also asked about a recent interview Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour did withThe Guardian, in which he was asked if he could persuade his friend Bush to get back on stage. He said in the interview: “Kate Bush is the only person who can get Kate Bush back on stage. I think the shows she did in 2014 at the Hammersmith Apollo were some of the best I’ve ever seen. We went several nights. I’ve tried persuading her recently, actually. Gently.” Responding in good humor, Bush replied: “I’m not there yet.” She said she loved doing the shows that Gilmour referenced but that the whole crew had been “so exhausted by the time we got to actually the first night.”",Global
99,"Hillary Clinton says Trump is ‘more unhinged, more unstable’ than in 2016","Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said Thursday that former President Donald Trump is now “more unhinged, more unstable” and more dangerous than when she faced him in the 2016 presidential election. “I think he’s more unhinged, more unstable,” the losing 2016 Democratic nominee told CNN’s Kaitlan Collins on “The Source.” “I think you see that all the time in both his rallies and his kind of word-salad-after-word-salad speeches.” Clinton – the first woman to capture a major-party nomination for president – also drew a contrast between her 2016 effort and Kamala Harris’ campaign, saying the vice president has centered her message on reminding voters how dangerous Trump could be for the country. “I think that she’s running her campaign based on a lot of the lessons that we have learned over the last eight years. First and foremost, how incredibly dangerous Donald Trump is. That wasn’t maybe as clear as it should have been back in 2016. But it sure is now,” Clinton said. “And I think her warnings, the warnings of not just Democrats like President Obama, but the people who actually observed him up close for the four years he was actually in the White House are warning us with everything they possibly can say.” Clinton’s comments on “The Source” come days after the publication of remarks by Trump’s former chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, who said in new interviews that the former president met the definition of a “fascist.” Kelly, who was Trump’s chief of staff from 2017 to 2019, also toldThe New York Timesthat the former president “certainly prefers the dictator approach to government” and confirmed toThe Atlanticthat Trump had said he wished his military personnel showed him the same deference Adolf Hitler’s Nazi generals showed the German dictator during World War II. Trump on Thursday denied saying that he needed “the kind of generals that Hitler had” and bashed The Atlantic when asked by CNN about the reported comments. “No, I never said that. I would never say that. It’s a rag that he made up stories. He’s done it before,” the former president said. “Right before the election, it’s just a failing magazine.” At theCNN town hall with Harrison Wednesday, the vice president said, “Yes, I do” when asked if she considers Trump a fascist. She also called him “dangerous” and warned of Trump’spromise to use the Justice Departmentto attack critics and former allies if elected again. Clinton said Thursday she agreed with Kelly and Harris that Trump met the definition of a fascist and urged people “who don’t want to go there” to “please open your eyes to the danger that this man poses to our country.” Asked what she thinks Harris should do to avoid a repeat of 2016, Clinton dryly recalled a politically damaging federal probe that then-FBI director James Comey reopened days before the election. “Well, first of all, I don’t think she has Jim Comey in the wings waiting to kneecap her. So that’s good and I’m very grateful for that,” Clinton said. CNN’s Kate Sullivan and Eric Bradner contributed to this report.",Global
100,"Vince McMahon, embattled former CEO of WWE, sued for allegedly enabling sexual abuse","A new lawsuit alleges Vince McMahon knowingly enabled the sexual exploitation of children by a WWE employee in the 1980s. The suit, filed on behalf of five former WWE “Ring Boys,” alleges McMahon, his wife Linda McMahon, the WWE, and TKO Group Holdings, the league’s parent company, knowingly allowed former ringside announcer Melvin Phillips, Jr. to use his position to sexually exploit children as young as 12 and 13 years old. “Phillips lured and manipulated the young boys with promises of meeting famous wrestlers and attending the highly popular wrestling shows, experiences that were otherwise unattainable for these kids,” the lawsuit alleges. “(The McMahons and the WWE) allowed Phillips and others to engage in, and foster, the WWE’s rampant culture of sexual abuse.” The WWE did not immediately respond to CNN’s request for comment. Jessica Rosenberg, an attorney for Vince McMahon, called the allegations false. As early as 1992, New York Post columnist Phil Mushnick wrote about Phillips’ alleged abuse of Ring Boys at the WWE. “More than 30 years ago, the columnist Phil Mushnick tried to make headlines with these same false claims. Those allegations were never proven,” Rosenberg said in a statement. “The negligence claims against Mr. McMahon that were asserted today rely on these same absurd, defamatory and utterly meritless statements by Mr. Mushnick. We will vigorously defend Mr. McMahon and are confident the court will find that these claims are untrue and unfounded.” The suit, filed in Baltimore County, Maryland, on behalf of five John Does, alleges Phillips would recruit children to work as “Ring Boys,” helping him run errands to set up for WWE events. However, the job was a guise for sexually exploiting the boys, which Phillips would do even in front of wrestlers and executives in the locker area, the lawsuit alleges. The lawsuit alleges McMahon was aware of Phillips’ abuse of the children. In fact, the lawsuit alleges McMahon admitted that he was aware as early as the 1980s that Phillips had a “peculiar and unnatural interest” in young boys. Phillips worked for the WWE in the 1970s, 80s and 90s as a “prominent” ringside announcer and crew chief. He died in 2012. “It was common knowledge in the WWE—among the ring crew, wrestlers, and executives—that Phillips surrounded himself with a posse of underaged Ring Boys, including when he traveled across state lines and stayed in hotel rooms with the children,” the lawsuit alleges. According to the lawsuit, the McMahons fired Phillips in 1988 after allegations about him sexually exploiting children continued to surface. Yet they rehired him six weeks later, and the lawsuits alleges he continued recruiting young men to sexually exploit. The lawsuit alleges the McMahons re-hired Phillips on the condition that he “steer clear from kids,” yet he did not, and they knowingly let it happen. Phillips would often film his sexual abuse of the underage Ring Boys on video camera, the lawsuit alleges. “After decades of suffering in silence from their childhood trauma, these survivors come forward now to hold (McMahon and the WWE) accountable for their conduct in allowing the systemic and pervasive abuse by Philips,” the lawsuit alleges. No one has ever been criminally charged. Linda McMahon stepped down as CEO of WWE in 2009. She worked in former President Donald Trump’s cabinet as the 25th administrator of the Small Business Administration before stepping down in 2019. This lawsuit is the latest in a series of misconduct allegations against McMahon and the WWE. In 2022, McMahonsteppeddown as CEO of WWE and the following year paid a multimillion-dollarsettlementto Rita Chatterton, a former employee and referee, who accused McMahon of raping her in 1986. McMahon returned to WWE’s board in January 2023. The Wall Street Journal previouslyreportedin 2022 McMahon had paid more than $12 million to four women to cover up “allegations of sexual misconduct and infidelity.” In January, McMahon stepped down as chairman of TKO, WWE’s parent company, following allegations of sexual assault and trafficking. McMahon has denied the allegations.",Not Found

102,The world’s best bars for 2024 announced,"A two-level speakeasy in Mexico City’s hip Colonia Juarez neighborhood has been proclaimed the world’s best bar. Handshake Speakeasy clinched the title last night in Madrid, where a splashy awards ceremony was held by the World’s 50 Best association. It’s a huge achievement for a bar that only opened its (downstairs) doors in 2023. Handshake Speakeasy was third on the list last year. Another newcomer landed in second place. Hong Kong’s Italian-style Bar Leone, which aims to propagate the concept of “cocktail populari” or “cocktail for the people,” was crowned thebest bar in Asia. In third position waslast year’s No. 1, Barcelona’s Sips. The 33-seat cocktail spot may be relatively new – it opened in 2021 and won the world’s best title two years later – but it is benefitted by star power behind the scenes. One of its owners spent years working at laudedSpanish restaurant El Bulliand the other built his resume at award-winning London bar Artesian. The rest of the list brought mixologists and bar owners from points as far as Athens, Tokyo, Sydney and Lima to the party. The World’s 50 Best voters are a mix of industry professionals, including bartenders and food and drink writers. The organization describes its annual list as “a snapshot of the opinions and experiences of 700 bar industry experts across the globe,” and says there is no specific criteria that judges are asked to consider beyond their personal opinions. While new names landed in a few of the top spots, there were also established bars showing they still have staying power. Singapore’s Jigger & Pony has consistently ranked on the 50 Best list since its opening in 2012. Crowned No. 1 in Asia in 2020, the cocktail spot managed to survive through the pandemic. Meanwhile, at Tokyo’s Bar Benfiddich, drinkers have been queuing up since 2013 to try and order a drink at this tiny, local-loved establishment in fashionable Shinjuku. It landed at No. 25 this year. Good news for travelers: some of this year’s standout cocktail spots are located in hotels, making them even easier to visit. Two of London’s most-lauded bars are in hotels: Scarfes Bar is on the ground floor of the glamorous Rosewood hotel, while Connaught Bar is housed inside the elegant Mayfair hotel from which it takes its name. Mimi Kakushi, the list’s sole representative from Dubai, is inside the luxurious Four Seasons on Jumeirah Road. Named after a classic Japanese hairstyle, it was ranked the Best Bar in the Middle East and Africa this year. Meanwhile, Singapore’s Jigger & Pony is located in the city’s low key Amara Hotel. Travelers who want to cross as many award-winning bars off their list as possible might want to head to London or New York City, which each have four bars in the top 50. Buenos Aires and Mexico City have three apiece. The “bartender’s bartender” prize, which is awarded annually to a mixologist by their peers, was given to Iain McPherson of Edinburgh’s 30th-place Panda & Sons. McPherson, a Scotland native who also produces a line of boozy ice creams called Senor Scoops, was hailed by his fellow bartenders as being innovative and humorous in his approach. “Thanks to everyone that voted and rates me at this position. Thank you to the amazing teams I get to work with, that deliver my visions, better than I ever can,” he wrote in a statement on Instagram. “Congrats to all the others on the list. I also know it’s impossible to have everyone deserving of a place, mentioned on this list, so just keep doing the great things you are doing!”",Not Found
103,"Ballot boxes burned, hundreds of votes destroyed in Washington, Oregon arson cases","Two ballot boxes were burned in Washington and Oregon on Monday, possibly damaging hundreds of mail-in votes with only about a week to go before Election Day. The Portland Police Bureau responded to reports of a fire in the Buckman neighborhood of the city at about 3:30 a.m. The fire had been extinguished by security personnel who work in the area, and officers soon found an ""incendiary device,"" characterizing the crime as arson. The Vancouver Police Department in nearby southern Washington said in a statement that they responded to an arson at a ballot box at 4 a.m. They found smoke coming out of the box and a ""suspicious object"" next to it. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said in a statement to USA TODAY that it is ""coordinating with federal, state and local partners to actively investigate the two incidents."" The FBI declined to comment on whether the arsons would be investigated as a domestic terror incident in a follow-up email. Clark County auditor Greg Kimsey said that a large number of ballots had been destroyed in the Vancouver fire at a joint press conference. ""We are still in the process of coming up with a closer number, but it certainly was hundreds,"" Kimsey said. Kimsey said that the fire suppression system in the Vancouver ballot box did not work. The last pick-up from the ballot box occurred at 11 a.m. Saturday, Kimsey told USA TODAY in an interview. Kimsey said that voters who believe their ballot was in the box when the fire occurred can request a new ballot at the county's voting website. He further said that there will be increased police and civilian security around the drop boxes and ballot pick-ups will occur at 5:30 p.m. Multnomah County election official Tim Scott said in the press conference that only three ballots had been destroyed in the Portland fire and that those voters would be contacted. The boxes that were burned are located about 15 miles away from each and police officials said that they believe the arsons are connected. Vancouver police said that Monday's arson was similar to one that occurred Oct. 8 before ballots were being mailed, according to The Oregonian. The Vancouver ballot box is located in Washington’s 3rd Congressional District, where Democratic House Rep. Marie Gluesenkamp Perez is attempting to retain her seat, which she won by less than 3,000 votes in 2022 against Republican challenger Joe Kent. Both candidates condemned the arsons on Monday. ""Southwest Washington cannot risk a single vote being lost to arson and political violence,"" Gluesenkamp Perez said in a statement. ""We can’t yield to intimidation, and we must continue to stand up against unpatriotic acts such as this one. ""Stay focused on driving voter turn out & early voting, don’t be deterred from voting by a cowardly act of terrorism,"" Kent said on X. This story has been updated with new information.",Not Found
104,"Creepy crawly spiders coming into your home? Don't kill them, experts say.","Fall is the time of year when homeowners may be noticing more spiders scurrying across their kitchen floors and setting up camp by weaving complex webs in the dark corners of their basements. Turns out, that as temperatures drop, our houses and the heating they provide are ideal places for eight-legged arachnids to find shelter, look for mates and hunt for prey to eat. Of course, unless you're an arachnologist, there's a good chance you don't particularly care to share your living space with the creepy crawlers. The urge to grab the nearest shoe, book or other flat object to squish any spider you see may be hard to resist. But many experts – yes, even pest control businesses – caution homeowners to exercise a little restraint. Here's why you may be noticing more spiders in your house, and why you should reconsider killing them. Though spiders are abundant from spring through fall across the United States, experts warn that more may be noticed inside our homes when temperatures start to drop and they seek out warm spaces to take shelter for the winter. Fall is also the time of year that most arachnids reach maturity and are full-grown, which may account for why you're noticing them more often. Our homes are rife with window sills and other small crevices in which spiders can hide, while trash cans and compost bins provide a plentiful food source of scavenging insects, said Lisa Gonzalez, a program manager at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, home to the spider pavilion where about 300 spiders of up to 15 species live. What's more, structures like houses provide plenty of sturdy attachment points for their webs. That is to say, our homes are great places for spiders to live, which means it's also where they're going to reproduce. Late summer and early fall is typically when male webspinners, hoping to put their newly-developed sex organs to the test, leave their webs in search of female mates, said Anne Danielson-Francois, associate professor of biological sciences at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. The female spiders, depending on species, typically conserve their energy and remain at their spun homes, waiting on the males to come to them. ""They are not necessarily more abundant than in the summertime, but individuals are more visible because they are larger,"" Danielson-Francois said. ""A small web might go unnoticed in your kitchen window, but once that spider has grown to full size and spins a web that covers a quarter of the window, you could not miss it."" The rule of thumb, experts say, should be this: If the spider isn't bothering you, then don't bother it. ""If you can allow an eight-legged roommate, it can benefit you,"" Danielson-Francois said. ""And they provide free Halloween decorations for your home, wherever you prefer them – inside or out."" So, what is the benefit of a mutual existence with a creature whose mere sighting inside a home sends many fleeing from the room? It's because spiders are predators that keep insect populations in check. If left alone spiders provide free pest control, eating more obnoxious pests such as flies, said Allen Lawrance, associate curator of entomology at the Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum located in Chicago and operated by the Chicago Academy of Science. Even companies who make a profit by eliminating unwanted pests recommend that home owners leave spiders alone. On its website, Orkin touts the advantages of having some of the creepy-crawlers around, writing that the arachnids can keep away (or feed on) pests that are actually harmful, like disease-carrying ticks and fleas. ""Spiders are also extremely beneficial to our ecosystem and control the number of bugs that destroy plants and crops, which is why scientists ask us not to kill them,"" Orkin writes. In its own post, Romney Pest Control largely agreed, adding that the presence of dangerous spiders such as the brown recluse spider, whose bite often requires medical treatment, may require contacting a professional. Arachnologists do acknowledge that many people are fearful of spiders and may not want them around. But there's no need to burn your house down to rid yourself of the critters. The important thing, though, is to remember that most species of spiders commonly found inside homes – like cobweb spiders and cellar spiders (better known as ""daddy longlegs"") – are not dangerous. ""While all spiders do produce some venom to help capture and consume their prey, none of these pose any real threat to humans,"" Lawrance said. While seeing spiders on a regular basis may be a sign of an infestation requiring professional help, a stray spider here or there is no cause for concern. But for those who just can't bring themselves to tolerate the presence of spiders, they have a few options recommended by arachnologists and pest control companies alike: ""Don’t feel bad for the spider, they can survive outside quite well,"" Danielson-Francois said. ""With substances in their blood that act like antifreeze, some species can overwinter under tree bark or in leaf litter just fine."" Even Gonzalez said she removes widow spiders, which have venom that can cause problematic reactions if they bite, from her mailbox and underneath patio furniture. ""Every other spider I see in and around my house,"" she said, ""is welcome to set up camp."" Editor's note: A version of this story was last published in 2023.

105,NASA identifies 9 possible landing spots for 2026 mission returning humans to the moon,"NASA plans to bring humankind back to the moon but first needs to figure out exactly where to land. The space agency has outlined nine potential lunar landing sites for its Artemis III mission, the agency's first planned return to the moon in over five decades. The mission, slated for 2026, intends to land near the lunar South Pole, where astronauts will visit unexplored areas, according to NASA. The nine regions selected are areas where crew can safely land to help uncover new discoveries and better grasp how to live on the lunar surface, according to NASA. The agency has not determined a priority ranking for the selected regions. During the selection process experts considered terrain suitability, launch window availability, lighting conditions, science potential and communication capabilities with Earth, among other factors. NASA officials also considered the combined trajectory capabilities of its Space Launch System rocket, the Orion spacecraft and Starship Human Landing System. ""The Moon’s South Pole is a completely different environment than where we landed during the Apollo missions,"" Artemis lunar science lead Sarah Noble said in a statement. ""It offers access to some of the Moon’s oldest terrain, as well as cold, shadowed regions that may contain water and other compounds. Any of these landing regions will enable us to do amazing science and make new discoveries."" NASA has selected nine potential landing regions, each with its diverse geological characteristics and flexibility for mission landing. Each spot is in the lunar South Pole, which has never been explored in a crewed mission and features permanently shadowed areas that can preserve resources like water. The following lunar sites have been considered: The last human to land on the moon was on Dec. 19, 1972, during NASA's Apollo 17 mission. The astronauts on that mission were the last to visit the moon and the last to travel more than 400 miles from the Earth, according to the National Space Air and Space Museum. Humankind first touched down on the moon on July 20, 1969, during the Apollo 11 mission in which Neil Armstrong became the first man to step foot on the moon. Artemis III, which will send two astronauts to the surface of the moon, is scheduled for September 2026. Artemis II, which will send astronauts around the moon, is slated for September 2025.",Global

Cleotha Abston, 40, was able to avoid the death penalty with the guilty plea to first-degree murder and will face life in prison without the possibility of parole. Fletcher, who was 34 at the time of her death, was abducted while out on a run in the early hours of Sept. 2, 2022. Her body was not found until three days later. ""No legal resolution and no sentence can diminish the anguish of Liza's murder,"" Fletcher's family said in a statement sent to the news media. ""We accept the outcome that her murderer has pled guilty to all charges, will wake up in prison for the rest of his life and cannot harm anyone else. We are very grateful for the determination and professionalism of law enforcement and the district attorney's office."" Abston was arrested on Sept. 3, 2022, a day after Fletcher's abduction launched a multi-day, multi-agency manhunt across Memphis. He was initially charged with especially aggravated kidnapping and tampering with evidence. Footage from the University of Memphis campus, where Fletcher was taken while on a morning run, showed someone in a dark SUV approach Fletcher and force her into the vehicle after a brief struggle. First-degree murder and first-degree murder in perpetration of a kidnapping charges were added to Abston's case a day after Fletcher's remains were found. Abston pleaded guilty to Fletcher's killing to avoid the death penalty, his attorney, Juni Ganguli, told USA TODAY. Ganguli and attorney Lauren Pasley both advised Abston to plead guilty due to the mounting evidence against him. Ganguli added that a jury would have likely imposed the death penalty during a sentencing hearing. ""I've had other death penalty cases where the prosecution had agreed to sentences of life without parole following the guilt phase of trials,"" Ganguli said in his statement. ""There was overwhelming publicity and public outcry in this case."" Abston was convicted of a 2021 rape over six months before entering the plea on Monday. That rape went unsolved until DNA taken in a rape kit matched Abston. The trial spanned three days in April, when Abston was indicted for three different counts, aggravated rape, especially aggravated kidnapping and being a convicted felon in possession of a firearm. The jury convicted him of aggravated rape and convicted felon in possession of a handgun, and found him guilty of the lesser charge of aggravated kidnapping. Fletcher was the mother of two children and a teacher at St. Mary's Episcopal School. Before working joining St. Mary's, she taught Kindergarten at Promise Academy in Nashville and also coached soccer. In 2006, she graduated from Hutchison School in Memphis, according to the all-girl's school's website, and later earned a bachelor's degree in exercise science at Baylor University. She earned her masters of art in teaching with an emphasis in elementary education at Belmont University, according to a post from St. Mary's. She is also remembered as an avid runner, having run completed the St. Jude marathon in Memphis with a time of 3:26:09. She finished 22nd place out of all the women running the St. Jude marathon that year. Her placement allowed her to qualify for the elite Boston Marathon. George Robertson, the senior pastor at Second Presbyterian Church, said Fletcher was ""full of life."" She married Richard Fletcher III at the church in 2014, according to a 2015 report by Memphis Magazine. The couple shared two sons. ""She and her husband Ritchie are both very active and great leaders in our congregation,"" Robertson told the Commercial Appeal, part of the USA TODAY Network. ""They have two little boys who have come up to me every week and give me a hug."" In a statement, her family addressed Abston: ""We have no idea what happened to you to turn you into someone so filled with a desire to hurt people. Whatever it was, it does not excuse or explain what you have done. You have changed our lives forever, and nothing will ever be the same,"" they said. ""Your actions were evil. There is no other word for it. You murdered Liza, even though she did nothing to deserve it.""",Memphis
107,Cold case: 'Lake Lady Jane Doe' identified 38 years after body found in Louisiana lake,"On June 19, 1986, a fisherman found a woman's body floating in a lake in southeastern Louisiana. For nearly four decades, the unidentified homicide victim was only known by the name ""Lake Lady Jane Doe"" until last week, when the St. Tammany Parish Sheriff’s Office in Covington announced new DNA technology had identified the victim. The sheriff's office said that the woman had been identified as 33-year-old Pamela Lee Hupp. As of Monday, Hupp's killer's identity remained unknown, the sheriff's office told USA TODAY. After Hupp's remains were discovered in Lake Pontchartrain near Slidell, about 30 miles northeast of New Orleans, they were turned over to the St. Tammany Parish Coroner’s Office. Hupp's manner of death was ruled a homicide, coroner's spokesperson James Hartman told USA TODAY on Monday, and her death certificate showed she died as a result of asphyxia. Officials also said she was pregnant. At the time of the discovery, she was estimated to be 20 to 30 years old, according to Othram, the DNA lab that eventually helped identify Hupp. During the investigation, authorities reconstructed Hupp's skull, from which a photograph was captured and released to the public, the sheriff's office said. Her story was also included on a segment that aired on ""America's Most Wanted."" Years later, in September 2022, a grant paved the way for more DNA analysis and genealogy research in the case. Then in April 2023, Othram's efforts helped locate potential family members of the victim who later helped lead to her identity. Born in April 1958, her last known residence was in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. It was not immediately known what she was doing in Florida at the time of her killing or how she was killed. “I want to thank the many investigators over the years who worked on this case and sought out available resources and technology to identify and give a name to the victim,” Sheriff Randy Smith released in a statement after the victim's identity was released. “Our detectives will not stop working until they have identified and arrested the person(s) responsible for Ms. Hupp’s death.” Anyone with information about the case is asked to call the sheriff's office at (985) 898-2341 or Detective Winston Harbin at (985) 276-1355.

108,US Navy officially apologizes for bombarding a native Alaskan community in 1882,"The U.S. Navy made an official apology this week for the bombardment and near destruction of a native Alaskan village 142 years ago. Speaking Saturday in Angoon, Alaska, located about 100 miles south of the state capital of Juneau in the Tongass National Forest, Rear Adm. Mark Sucato, commander of Navy Region Northwest issued the apology on the 142nd anniversary of the attack, which happened on Oct. 26, 1882 and killed six children while leaving the village's surviving residents without food or shelter amid a harsh winter. “The Navy recognizes the pain and suffering inflicted upon the Tlingit people, and we acknowledge these wrongful actions resulted in the loss of life, the loss of resources, the loss of culture, and created and inflicted intergenerational trauma on these clans,” Sucato said at the ceremony, which was livestreamed by the Sealaska Heritage Institute. “The Navy takes the significance of this action very, very seriously and knows an apology is long overdue.” While many details of what caused the destruction at Angoon have been lost to time over the years, what is known is that it began with the accidental death of a Tlingit shaman, who was killed aboard a whaling ship by an exploding harpoon gun. According to the Naval Heritage and History Command, accounts from the time say members of the Tlingit tribe forced the whaling ship to shore and took multiple hostages from the crew, along with demanding a ransom of 200 blankets, prompting the call for help by local officials from the Navy. When the Navy arrived at Angoon, they proceeded to destroy the village − burning canoes, food stores, and homes − leaving six children dead and the survivors stranded, entirely dispossessed. The village received a $90,000 settlement in 1973, and in 1982 the Navy sent a letter to the Kootznoowoo Heritage Foundation acknowledging their role in the affair and writing that, ""The destruction of Angoon should never have happened, and it was an unfortunate event in our history."" The village, however, had long sought an official acknowledgement and apology for the event. ""Thank you, Angoon, for keeping our culture so and so strong,"" said Rosita Worl, president of the Sealaska Heritage Institute, at the ceremony. Last month, the Navy conducted a similar apology, for the burning and bombardment of the Tlingit village of Kake in 1869, according to Alaska Public Media. On Oct. 25, President Joe Biden became the first U.S. president to officially apologize for the abuses committed at Native American boarding schools for more than a century.

109,"Feds: Massachusetts pizzeria chain owner sentenced for forced labor, deportation threats","The owner of a Massachusetts pizzeria chain was sentenced to more than eight years in prison for physically abusing six employees and threatening them with further violence and deportation if they did not comply with his ""excessive workplace demands,"" federal authorities announced. Stavros Papantoniadis, also known as Steve Papantoniadis, was handed an eight-and-a-half-year sentence in a District of Massachusetts courtroom months after being found guilty of three counts of forced labor and three counts of attempted forced labor, according to a Justice Department news release. “Labor trafficking exploits the vulnerable through fear and intimidation, all in pursuit of the almighty buck. That is what Stavros Papantoniadis did when he violated the rights of the people working in his restaurants. He deliberately hired foreign nationals who lacked authorization to work in the United States and then turned their lack of immigration status against them, threatening them with deportation and violence to keep them under his control,” U.S. Attorney Joshua S. Levy said in the release. Steven C. Boozang, Papantoniadis' attorney, told USA TODAY that his client was a ""pillar of the community"" and had no quarrels with any of the hundreds of people he's previously employed since he began his business over 32 years ago. ""He had done a lot for the community,"" Boozang said. Lawsuit: Ohio nursing home didn't tell family about fatal pressure wound The 49-year-old from Westwood, Massachusetts forced or attempted to force five men and one woman to do excessive labor at his shop, Stash's Pizza, by abusing them and repeatedly threatening to contact immigration authorities, according to the Justice Department. Federal prosecutors said Papantoniadis ""thinly staffed"" his two Stash's Pizza locations, in Dorchester and Roslindale, on purpose and employed individuals without immigration status to work for 14 hours or more a day for up to seven days a week. One of the employees would work between 84 and 119 hours per week, according to a federal complaint obtained by USA TODAY. In addition to threatening the workers with physical harm and deportation, Papantoniadis monitored them with surveillance cameras and ""constantly demeaned, insulted and harassed them,"" according to the Justice Department. When Papantoniadis learned one of the workers planned on quitting, he ""violently choked him,"" federal authorities said. When other workers told Papantoniadis they intended to quit, the owner told one of them that ""he would kill him"" and call immigration authorities, while he threatened another by telling him he knew where he lived, the Justice Department said. Another worker told authorities that Papantoniadis chased him down Route 1 in Norwood, Massachusetts and falsely reported him to local police so he would return to work at the pizza shop, according to the release. Boozang said the allegations the six workers brought against Papantoniadis were ""extremely suspect"" for several reasons, including the Stash's Pizza owner paying for their vacations, buying their kids Christmas gifts and even paying for one of their weddings. In addition to the things Papantoniadis allegedly did for the six workers, Boozang said he found it odd that no previous employees had complained about his client. ""(Papantoniadis) has had hundreds and hundreds of employees over the years, many who have come back,"" according to the attorney. Papantoniadis also paid the six workers up to $17 an hour for the 70-hour work weeks, which they requested, Boozang said. ""He gave them what they wanted,"" Boozang said. The U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hours Division (DOL-WHD) brought a civil case against Papantoniadis on March 24, 2017, for ""overtime wage violations,"" according to court documents. The civil suit was resolved on March 27, 2019, and five out of the six workers who were a part of the criminal case received compensation for back wages and liquidated damages through Papantoniadis' settlement with the DOL-WHD, court records say. Boozang said the forced labor allegations against Papantoniadis ""came out of the woodwork,"" and that the six workers ""read the script."" Although Boozang's suspicions were raised during Papantoniadis' trial, a jury found his client guilty in June. ""Papantoniadis exploited and abused his employees, denying them the basic dignity every person deserves,"" Michael J. Krol, Special Agent in Charge for Homeland Security Investigations in New England, said in the release. ""Today’s significant sentence sends a message to employers — employees deserve to work in safety, free from harassment and abuse and exploitative employers will be held to account.""",Not Found
110,Ohio family files lawsuit against nursing home after woman's pressure wound death,"An Ohio woman’s family has filed a lawsuit against the nursing home she was treated at after she developed a pressure wound that became infected and ultimately killed her. The nursing home is located in Oregon, a northwest Ohio city just outside of Toledo. Lucy Garcia, 72, was admitted to Arbors at Oregon on Jan. 25, 2023 for long term residential care after having a stroke, according to a lawsuit filed Wednesday afternoon in Lucas County. She died nearly a year-and-a-half later on July 2, 2024 due to a pressure ulcer that became infected, leading to sepsis. The Lucas County Coroner performed an autopsy on Garcia and reviewed her medical records from St. Charles Medical Center and Arbors at Oregon. The coroner ruled her manner of death homicide, and an autopsy report obtained lists her death as the result of “caretaker neglect resulting in complications of a sacral pressure wound.” Matt Mooney, an attorney representing the Garcia family, filed the lawsuit on the family’s behalf and said the filing is “the first step towards bringing Lucy Garcia’s killers to justice.” Read more: Ohio family says they plan to sue nursing home after matriarch's death ruled a homicide Citing medical negligence and recklessness, the lawsuit blames the facility for Garcia’s death and calls for at least $25,000 in damages plus attorney’s fees and other expenses. “We will stop at nothing to hold the Arbors and its corporate controllers accountable for creating a system of putting profits over people - a system that they knew caused horrific injuries and death to their residents like Lucy,” Mooney wrote in a statement to USA TODAY on Friday. Arbors at Oregon did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Garcia’s stroke had made her heavily reliant on the workers at Arbors at Oregon, her family alleged in the lawsuit. The stroke took a toll on her left side, primarily her left arm, and doctors were aware that she needed help getting in and out of bed, moving around in bed and getting to the bathroom. The facility told the Garcia family that staff would be able to care for their matriarch’s needs. “Arbors at Oregon represented to Lucy’s family that they had sufficient numbers of well trained, qualified, and compassionate nursing staff to provide appropriate care to Lucy and all the other residents under their care,” the lawsuit read. But employees there knew resident needs could not be met and other patients had suffered from injuries such as bedsores, infections, falls and in Garcia’s case, death, the lawsuit alleges. According to the Garcia family’s lawsuit, the facility did not have enough staff members to properly care for residents, and the staff members that were there had not received the proper training, nor were they “compassionate to the needs and rights of the residents,” the lawsuit reads. The lawsuit also alleges that the facility had been investigated for multiple health and safety violations and failed to let Garcia’s family know about the violations, including recent criminal neglect and abuse accusations against nursing staff that led to the death of one patient. While Garcia needed help to do so, she could use the restroom, the lawsuit alleged. Rather than help her to the restroom, staff at Arbors at Oregon put her in adult diapers and told her staff would come and “clean her up” once she soiled herself. She was often left in soiled diapers for extended periods of time, “exposing her skin to her own bodily waste – which resulted in breakdown of the skin on her buttocks,” the lawsuit read. The day after she was admitted to Arbors at Oregon, staff completed an assessment to determine the likeness of her developing pressure or bedsores. She scored a 13, meaning she was at a moderate risk for developing bedsores. To prevent the sores, Garcia needed to be turned and repositioned regularly in bed, but her family alleges Arbors at Oregon’s staff did not do this. Staff first noted that Garcia developed a sore on March 5 this year. Just 8 days later, Arbors at Oregon noted that the “abrasion” had grown and a photo was taken, the lawsuit alleged. The sore developed “in-house,” according to the lawsuit. Staff referred to the sore as an “abrasion.” When skilled nursing facilities have patients who develop bedsores, they must report the bedsores to the Centers for Medicare, which may negatively impact the facility’s quality measures rating, the lawsuit read. According to the Garcia family’s lawsuit, someone at Arbors at Oregon told staff to log bed sores as different types of wounds so the facility’s quality measures score would not be impacted. The family argued that this allowed the facility to dupe members of the public into believing their loved ones would be properly cared for at the facility. By March 25, Arbors at Oregon’s nursing staff had noted that the sore was “resolved” despite it still being visible on her backside, the lawsuit read. There were also discrepancies in her file regarding when the wound began to develop. According to the lawsuit, the facility did not document the wound as a pressure wound until June 13, just over 3 months after it first developed. Her family still hadn’t been told about the pressure wound. On June 19, Arbors at Oregon contacted the Garcia family and told them Garcia was nearing the end of her life, and said she needed to be put in hospice care. Her family came to visit and found her barely responsive, their lawyer wrote in the lawsuit. Garcia’s sons told facility staff that Garcia was recently feeling well enough to go to church. They didn’t understand how things could deteriorate so quickly, according to the lawsuit. Facility staff did not tell the family what happened, nor did they tell her about the wound, the document read. Garcia’s other family members in her room noticed an odor coming from her, then turned her over and saw a loose bandage on her backside that was beginning to peel back. There, they saw her bedsore, which had pus coming from it, the lawsuit read. Family members pushed for her to go to the hospital but the facility was hesitant. Eventually, Arbors at Oregon called an ambulance and Garcia was taken to the hospital. Doctors removed the bandages on her backside and found that she had a Stage 4 bedsore. “All the tissue on her backside down to her bone had died off, including muscle,” the lawsuit read. “The open bedsore was exposed to Lucy’s own feces and urine from Arbors at Oregon leaving her in soiled adult diapers, and the wound was infected with bacteria causing sepsis – a systemic infection of Lucy’s body.” The wound was so deep that bones in Garcia’s back were exposed, the lawsuit read. Doctors treated her with IV antibiotics and cleaned the wound. However, she died on July 2. The Garcia family and their lawyer argued in the lawsuit that she died “as a direct and proximate result of the negligence/recklessness” the nursing home showed when caring for her. Mooney, the family’s lawyer, previously told USA TODAY that Garcia had a large family. She was a single mother, raised four boys and was also a “motherly figure to all the kids in the neighborhood.” She was known to let people stay at her house for the night if they needed it, he said. “Her family really viewed her as the center of their family unit, and she was included in just about every single one of her grandchildren and great-grandchildren's births,” Mooney told USA TODAY in September. She leaves behind four sons, 17 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren. This story has been updated to clarify the amount the family is requesting in damages.

111,What should parents really be worried about this Halloween? Not razors in candy.,"As Halloween approaches, tips often circulate advising parents to check their children's Halloween candy, not for a tasty caramel center, but for potentially unsafe objects — like razor blades. But this year, experts are urging parents and caregivers to be mindful of other, more common, Halloween dangers, like vehicle traffic and food allergies. On average, children are more than twice as likely to get hit by a car while trick-or-treating than any other day, Safe Kids Worldwide, an international nonprofit dedicated to child safety, reports. Here's what adults and children should know before trick-or-treating on Thursday. To help keep kids safe from traffic incidents while traversing streets on Halloween night, Safe Kids Worldwide provides the following tips: The nonprofit also advised parents to think about what types of face coverings their children are wearing, as masks can obstruct a child's vision while walking. Food allergies can also be a dangerous around the Halloween season. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) advises parents who have children with allergies to check candy labels to ensure allergens aren't present. Parents should also never allow children to eat homemade baked goods they may have received. Generally, children should also never accept or eat items that are not commercially wrapped, the FDA advises. If parents are concerned about potential tampering, they should look for unusual wrapper appearances or discoloration, tiny pinholes, or tears in wrappers. In an effort to aid children navigating food allergies, Food Allergy Research & Education (FARE) created the Teal Pumpkin Project. The project encourages households to offer non-food items to trick-or-treaters so allergens may be avoided altogether. FARE recommends items like glow sticks, bubbles, bouncy balls, finger puppets, playing cards, stickers and other Halloween toys as non-food item options. Those looking to participate should visit the FARE website, where they can add their address to the Teal Pumpkin Project Map and find resources for how to let neighbors know. Fear-mongering about dangerous items, like razor blades and poison, in Halloween candy dates back to the 1960s. In October 1964, a New York woman was arrested for handing out ant poison and dog treats to trick-or-treaters, according to the History Channel. When she was questioned, the woman said she had only been joking and gave out these items to children she believed were too old to be trick-or-treating. Fortunately, no children were poisoned. Perhaps the most notable Halloween poisoning took place in October 1974, when a Texas man named Ronald O'Bryan handed out ""cyanide-laced pixie sticks"" to five trick-or-treaters, including his own son, according to the History Channel. Only O'Bryan's son ate the candy and he died soon after. No one saw O'Bryan lace the pixie sticks, but investigators learned that he had pulled out life insurance policies on his children. He was convicted of murder and executed via lethal injection in 1984, according to the History Channel. University of Delaware Sociology professor Joel Best has studied these instances of dangerous items placed in Halloween candy, which he calls ""Halloween Sadism,"" for decades. In 1985, he co-authored ""The Razor Blade in the Apple: The Social Construction of Urban Legends,"" a research article that largely discusses the history of dangerous treats given to children on Halloween. Continuing his research on the topic, Best stated between 1959 and 2012, 85 incidents of ""Halloween Sadism"" have been reported in the United States, per his website. A recent example occurred in 2015, when an Ohio child found a disposable razor blade in a Snickers candy bar received while trick-or-treating, per previous USA TODAY reporting. The child, and others in the area, were fortunately not hurt. Greta Cross is a national trending reporter at USA TODAY. Follow her on X and Instagram @gretalcross. Story idea?

112,Bear attack or murder? Bizarre 911 call leads to manhunt in Tennessee,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. − A manhunt was underway Monday for a slaying suspect who police say used a bogus identity when he made a bizarre 911 call claiming he fell off a cliff while running from a bear near the scenic Cherohala Skyway in rural southeast Tennessee. The call came in on Oct. 18 from near Tellico Plains, Tennessee, about 50 miles southwest of Knoxville in the foothills of the Great Smoky Mountains. The caller identified himself as Brandon Andrade and said he hit his head and could not move his legs. Monroe County Sheriff Tommy Jones said first responders descending on the scene found a man's body and Andrade's ID. Detectives determined the victim was not Andrade and had been murdered, Jones said. Ten days later the identity of the victim remains a mystery. Sheriff's detectives discovered the ID had been stolen and used several times by Nicholas Hamlett, 45, who was wanted by police in Alabama for a parole violation. Jones said Hamlett used another false name when speaking with detectives after the 911 call. By the time his real identity had been verified, Hamlett had fled the area, Jones said. FBI search: Man said a bear chased him off a cliff when he called 911 An arrest warrant charging first-degree murder has been issued for Hamlett, Jones said in a news release issued Friday. ""Mr. Hamlett is considered armed and dangerous,"" Jones warned. ""If you see Mr. Hamlett, please call 911."" Tellico Plains is on the 43-mile Cherohala Skyway that passes through the Cherokee National Forest, which is federal land and runs to Robbinsville, North Carolina. The Knoxville News Sentinel, part of the USA TODAY Newtork, obtained recordings of the call being relayed by dispatch. “Units en route to the area of Cherohala Skyway at Falls Branch Road. Have a male subject that fell off a cliff. He is unable to move. He was running from a bear. He has 2% battery – unable to get him back on 911. ... Not able to move his legs. Did hit his head. He’s going to be at the falls …” The FBI, state and local authorities are now looking for Hamlett − and for the identity of the victim. The sheriff's office said Monday that there were no updates on the case and that a briefing was planned for Wednesday.

113,Boo-tiful weather? See what your 2024 Halloween forecast has in store,"You've got the candy, costumes and decorations all ready. Now will the weather cooperate for your Halloween celebrations? Here's how the weather will affect the goblins, ghosts and ghouls in your neighborhood on Halloween evening: The nation's two soggiest spots on Halloween − Thursday − will likely be in portions of the central U.S. and the much of the Northwest. And though warmth will make news in some areas, what will be missing is widespread cold, forecasters said: ""This year, there are no major concerns as far as snow, ice or cold across much of the country,"" AccuWeather meteorologist Paul Pastelok said in an online forecast. ""A cold front will sweep across the central U.S. mid to late week, bringing the chance of rain from the Great Lakes to the Mississippi Valley on Halloween,"" said Weather.com meteorologist Caitlin Kaiser in an online forecast. Pastelok added that ""thunderstorms can occur from Houston northward to Little Rock and Memphis, Tennessee,"" noting that multiple showers and thunderstorms in this region may warrant bringing an umbrella for trick-or-treating or even taking shelter indoors. Farther north, he said rain may dampen festivities in parts of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region, including in Detroit and Cleveland. However, according to the Storm Prediction Center, the threat for severe weather appears ""marginal"" as of Monday. While portions of the central U.S. dodge raindrops, the main weather story for folks along the Eastern Seaboard will be the unusual, potential record-breaking warmth. How warm? High temperatures Thursday are expected to range from the 70s in New England to near 80 degrees across much of the Mid-Atlantic, AccuWeather predicts. According to Kaiser, ""h​igh temperatures could approach daily records in some Northeast cities, including Albany, New York, Hartford, Connecticut, and Trenton, New Jersey."" The Southeast will see above-average warmth as well: ""People may need to bring fans with them in Raleigh and Charlotte as temperatures will start in the 80s for trick-or-treating and fall back into the 70s,"" Pastelok said. The dreariest, chilliest spot on Halloween night is likely to be the Pacific Northwest, where rain or even high-elevation snow is possible, AccuWeather said rain and cool temperatures from a sweeping cold front could produce a double whammy in Seattle and Portland, forcing some costumes under jackets. Snow is even possible in the mountains: ""The higher elevations in the Northwest, above 2,000 feet, can experience some tricks from Mother Nature with wintry conditions,"" Pastelok said. In the Southwest, AccuWeather says there will be no weather-related concerns as kids and adults fill the neighborhood streets.",Not Found
114,"3 dead, 3 injured in shootings at Minneapolis homeless encampments: 'Cold-blooded killing'","Minneapolis police are investigating back-to-back fatal shootings over the weekend involving a half-dozen people at two separate homeless encampments in the city. As of Monday, no arrests had been made in the shootings that left a combined three people dead and a fourth person clinging to life. Meanwhile, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey tied the shooting and other recent violence at encampments to the drug fentanyl. The Minneapolis Police Department reported the first shooting took place Saturday just before 4:45 a.m., at a homeless encampment about two miles southeast of downtown. At the scene, the agency wrote in a release, officers located three men injured by gunfire. The victims were transported to a local hospital where one of the men, age 31, died, police said. On Monday, police Sgt. Garrett Parten told USA TODAY the other two victims' conditions were not immediately known. Homicide investigators said they were investigating what led up to the shooting, including the possibility that three suspects who left the scene on foot. Investigators were also working to determine ""what connection the three injured men had with the encampment,"" police wrote in a release. As of Monday morning, the suspects had not been located. 'Home Improvement' star: Zachery Ty Bryan charged with DUI in Oklahoma The second shooting took place the next day in broad daylight at another encampment along railroad tracks five miles southeast of downtown, police said. That camp is about three-and-half miles southeast of the scene of the first triple shooting. During that shooting, which took place about 2:20 p.m., unknown suspects shot three people in the camp − two men and one woman. The men, age 32 and 38, were both pronounced dead at the scene. Parten said the woman was taken to a hospital to be treated for life-threatening injuries. On Sunday, police announced three people were detained after the second shooting, but were later cleared and released. They did not elaborate. Chief says police 'failed' victim: Minneapolis man accused of shooting neighbor arrested Police said they have not ruled out the possibility both shootings are related, and said the case − including a motive for the attacks − remained under investigation. “The cold-blooded killing of three people inside the tent of an encampment is outrageous,” police Chief Brian O’Hara released in a statement Sunday. “All human life matters and encampments are not safe."" The Hennepin County Medical Examiner will release the victims' identities and their official cause and manner of death, police said. USA TODAY has reached out to the medical examiner's office. During a Sunday press conference, Frey said Minneapolis has seen an increase in homicides and shootings around homeless encampments across the city. ""This is another incredibly tragic and situation... it's not a coincidence this happened at homeless encampments,"" Frey said. ""We need to call a spade a spade. This is not about a lack of shelter... the issues that we're seeing in terms of crime and violence (are) about fentanyl."" The drug, a potential deadly narcotic, is a synthetic opioid approved for treating pain often laced into cocaine and other illicit recreational drugs. In cases where a mixture of fentanyl and cocaine isn’t fatal, it could increase the likelihood that the user develops an addiction. Drug dealers use fentanyl as a cheap way to amp up the power of other drugs, Tom Doub, chief clinical and compliance officer at addiction treatment company American Addiction Centers, previously told The Tennessean, part of the USA TODAY Network. The drugs are cheap to make, which means they are cheaper to buy on the street. Minneapolis City Council Member Jason Chavez pushed back on Frey tying the violence to fentanyl, local media outlet KARE 11 reported, accusing the mayor of pushing blame onto the city council. 'We are seeing folks that get evicted from their rental units end up in shelters or at encampments. That is not a fentanyl issue,"" Chavez said, per the outlet, while calling for a ""housing-first model."" ""If you can move someone into a tiny home with services, with mental health support, addiction services, an opportunity to have a job and a place to sleep at night, the likelihood that they're going to move into a permanent place and be stable has increased. That model works. Let's do more of that in the city of Minneapolis,"" Chavez said, per KARE 11. O'Hara said the department continues to address crime related issues associated with homeless encampments and the city continues to offer resources. ""To help end this cycle of violence that is exacerbated by narcotics and mental health issues, it is crucial that the residents of these encampments accept the resourced that are available,"" O'Hara said.

115,Weather extremes in the forecast this week: What to expect from coast-to-coast,"Weather extremes are forecast from coast-to-coast this week as a cold front moves inland off the Pacific and a bout of potentially record-breaking heat spreads eastward, producing strong thunderstorms in the central U.S. as the temperatures clash, meteorologists say. Soaring temperatures could break decades-old temperature records early this week from Texas to Minnesota and Michigan as temperatures rise 15-25 degrees above their historical averages, according to AccuWeather. Widespread afternoon temperatures will be in the 70s and 80s, with some south-central states potentially reaching 90 degrees. The warm weather is projected to spread east by Wednesday, ratcheting up daily highs to potentially record levels throughout the Mid-Atlantic region and elevating the risk of wildfires. On Halloween, daily record temperatures – some dating back to the 1940s and 1950s – could be broken in major Northeast cities, including Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and New York City, according to AccuWeather. A factor in the east's rising temperatures is a lack of rainfall, which is on pace to make October the driest month on record in Philadelphia and New York City, neither of which has received measurable amounts of rainfall since September. The dry conditions combined with gusty winds approaching from the west will lead to a sustained risk of wildfires across the Northeast, prompting warnings from meteorologists. ""This time of year, many people are doing yardwork and burning leaves and other smaller twigs or perhaps having evening bonfires with family and friends. Extra precautions will need to be taken when participating in these kinds of activities due to the high fire danger and how quickly fires could spread,"" said Dan Pydynowski, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather. ""It may be best to put off burning leaves and other yard waste until a change in the pattern brings wetter conditions with less wind."" As heat expands east, a cold front blowing in from the Rockies will alleviate high temperatures in the central U.S. but is expected to cause thunderstorms capable of flooding low-lying areas. The risk of storm outbreak will peak on Tuesday night across the south-central Plains and Upper Midwest, where ""strong to severe thunderstorms"" could produce damaging winds and hail, according to the National Weather Service. Through Wednesday and Thursday, forecasters expect rain to scuttle Halloween festivities in parts of the Ohio Valley and Great Lakes region, including major cities such as Detroit and Cleveland, according to AccuWeather. Thunderstorms may hamper holiday plans in the South, especially a swath of the region from Houston to Little Rock, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee. Rain is also forecast across the eastern coast of the Florida Peninsula, from Daytona to Miami and the Florida Keys. Though the rain could cause flooding, damaging winds and hail are the main hazards through the midweek, meteorologists said. Beginning over the weekend, a series of storms pushing across the Northwest from the Pacific began to unload cool air, rain, strong winds and, at high elevations, snow. On Monday, showers and thunderstorms are expected along the Pacific coasts of Oregon and Washington, where there is a possibility of ""localized flooding, mainly in low-lying and poor drainage areas,"" according to AccuWeather Meteorologist Alyssa Glenny. The rain will extend into Tuesday across the Pacific Northwest and Northern California, the weather service said. As the storms roll into the interior states, they will trigger snowfall across the high terrain of Utah, Wyoming and Colorado, AccuWeather said. Snow amounts could exceed half a foot across the central Rockies. The cool air will bring relief to some western states. In Las Vegas, which has sweltered in recent days amid afternoon highs in the 80s, the storms are projected to drop temperatures into the 60s this week.",Not Found

117,"1 dead, 1 critically injured after passengers were reportedly subway surfing in NYC","New York police are investigating after two passengers who were subway surfing Sunday fell between train cars, leaving 1 dead and 1 hospitalized. A person called the NYPD about the incident around 10:48 p.m. Sunday, the NYPD's Office of the Deputy Commissioner said Monday morning. The caller said a person had been hit by a train at the 111th Street subway station, part of the 115th Precinct, which includes a northern portion of Queens. According to the Office of the Deputy Commissioner, the southbound ""7"" train hit the female passengers. The office did not announce the ages of the passengers, but local television stations WNYW and WABC reported that they were teenagers. One of the passengers was pronounced dead at the scene while the other was taken to a hospital with trauma to the head, the Office of the Deputy Commissioner confirmed to USA TODAY. The second passenger was listed as being in critical condition. The girls got on the subway at the Flushing Main St. station, WABC reported, and were reportedly subway surfing, a trend where people ride on top of train cars. They were running on top of a moving subway as it headed west and had jumped between train cars. When the train stopped, the girls lost their balance and one of the girls fell under the train, the outlet reported. She also suffered a brain bleed, according to WABC. The outlet said the girls weren’t carrying identification, so police haven’t been able to notify their families. The identity of the deceased is pending at this time, the Office of the Deputy Commissioner said. Last year, five people died while subway surfing, reported WABC. The girl’s death is the sixth subway surfing death this year, according to WABC. Last week, a 13-year-old boy fell and died while subway surfing at the Forest Avenue subway station in Queens. The following day, a 20-year-old man died under similar circumstances, reported WNBC. Contributing: Saman Shafiq, USA TODAY Saleen Martin is a reporter on USA TODAY's NOW team.

118,Minneapolis man accused of shooting neighbor arrested; chief says police 'failed' victim,"A Minnesota man suspected of shooting his neighbor while he was cutting a tree was arrested and charged early Monday morning. His neighbor reported him to police several times before the shooting, officials say. The suspect, John Herbert Sawchak, 54, is believed to have shot his neighbor, Davis Moturi, on Oct. 23 from inside his Minneapolis home while the victim was cutting a tree. The victim reported Sawchak several times before, including after Sawchak is said to have threatened to shoot the victim if he touched the same tree he was cutting when Wednesday's shooting occurred, according to Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O’Hara. When Moturi's wife got home, she believed her husband had suffered from a heart attack and Emergency Medical Services transported him to the hospital, O’Hara said during a press briefing Friday. There, medical personnel discovered he'd been shot. The victim could not remember what happened before he was found unconscious, including that fact that he was shot, O'Hara said. No witnesses were around at the time of the shooting. USA TODAY reached out to the Minneapolis Police Department. Sergeant Garrett Parten confirmed the victim's name and directed USA TODAY to the press briefing on YouTube for the latest information. Florida murder: Palm Beach County man, 21, faces murder charge in failed drug deal Sawchak was arrested peacefully Monday morning after a SWAT operation that lasted several hours. ""Minneapolis Police exhausted all of our efforts to peacefully bring the situation to resolution (prior) to escalating the use of force with a SWAT team and special tactics,"" said O'Hara. Sawchak was charged with the following felonies, according to the Hennepin County Sheriff's Department: The suspect is being held on a $1 million bail and is set to a court appearance on Tuesday at 1:30 p.m., according to the department's arrest records. The victim had also reported his neighbor several times before the shooting and made several 911 calls regarding Sawchak. He also reported his neighbor before when he threatened to shoot him if he touched a specific tree, according to O’Hara. ""We failed this victim,"" O’Hara said Sunday night. ""He should not have been shot."" When police responded to the calls, Sawchak refused to open the door and speak with officers, according to O’Hara. A lieutenant had gone to the suspect's house over 20 times. The number does not include the times other officers have been called to the address. This led to the lieutenant giving his phone number to the victim, said O’Hara. The lieutenant asked the victim to call him when he did see Sawchak leave his home. Before Sunday night, police had concerns over an altercation and wanted to arrest the suspect where he did not have access to his firearms, but O'Hara said the man was a ""recluse"" and did not leave his house often. The suspect, who O'Hara said was ""mentally ill,"" was known to possess firearms, had violent confrontations in the past and refused to cooperate in ""the dozens of times that police officers have responded to the residence."" The execution of the arrest warrant was deemed ""high-risk."" ""Based on our assessment, the likelihood of an armed, violent confrontation where we may have to use deadly force with the suspect in this case is high,"" said O'Hara during a press briefing on Friday. ""Prior to Wednesday, all we had was a threats warrant.""",Minneapolis
